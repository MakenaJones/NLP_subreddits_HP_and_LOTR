lotr,"What I don‘t understand in Tolkiens work is the concept of evil and the responsibilities evil acts have on the person who executes it. 
Let me explain: IIRC when Morgoth longed for the silmaril he started to manilpulate the Noldor. His dark whispers created the concept of evil inside the hearts of the elves. Greed, hubris and selfish pride where emotions/ thoughts the elves didn‘t know before. Am I right? Morgoth brought evil to Arda and everything he touched got infested with it. 
I know his whispers fell on fertile ground with the Noldor, but only his interference caused the distrust for the Valar and the following desaster. So the kinslaying was a direct consequence of Morgoth‘ actions.

The kinslaying was cruel, yes, but was it right for the Valat to punish the Noldor that hard? Wouldn‘t it be wiser to forgive and show them right way? Especially when the Valar should be wise enough to know that the Elves wouldn‘t stand a chance against Morgoth on the long run? 
I find it odd for them to say „Nope. You don‘t fit our society of white heroes anymore. Go f urselves and see how you will handle YOUR consequences!“ when all of this was caused by one of their kind. I don‘t get it. It feels wrong. Especially if you look onto the suffering that the Noldor got back thousandfold afterwards. The children of Illuvatar did not know evil until Morgoth told them. The Valar were their to guide elves and men.

Maybe it's that nostalgia that makes me a little biased, but I feel like the soundtrack genuinely captured the essence of Middle-Earth, especially the Shire and One Ring themes.

When I found an audiobook that plays samples of the music score in the background, I felt greatly more immersed in Tolkien's world, especially the scenes in Baggend.

I find the Shire's music to be both relaxing and comforting, but at times it proposes a spirit of wonder at times. Perhaps even a bit adventurous. The inclusion of the violin makes old timey and rustic while the flute gives it the feeling of people who are closer to nature. It overall feels simple, but still promises fullness. If that makes sense.

Then I feel the One Ring's theme creates vibes of something old and until recently lost. It feels charming yet oddly sinister. Ask if the darkness behind it is more subtle than anything else.

One aspect of Gandalf's character that I find particularly interesting is his decision to spare Saruman at the end of The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Many readers may see this as a weakness in Gandalf's character, but I believe that it is a crucial part of his development.

Gandalf is not a vengeful or cruel character. Throughout the trilogy, he is shown to be a wise and compassionate leader, and his decision to spare Saruman reflects this. Gandalf understands that Saruman is no longer the powerful wizard he once was, and that he is now a broken and bitter old man. Instead of punishing him, Gandalf chooses to have mercy on him and allow him to live out the rest of his days in peace.

Furthermore, Gandalf's decision to spare Saruman also shows his commitment to the greater good. He recognizes that it is more important to focus on the defeat of Sauron and the restoration of peace in Middle-earth, rather than seeking revenge on a fallen enemy.

In conclusion, Gandalf's decision to spare Saruman is not a weakness, but rather a demonstration of his wisdom, compassion and his commitment to the greater good. By sparing Saruman, Gandalf is showing his wisdom in understanding that Saruman is no longer a threat, his compassion in not wanting to punish a broken man and his commitment to the greater good in focusing on the defeat of Sauron and the restoration of peace in Middle-earth.",Why Gandalf's decision to spare Saruman is a crucial part of his character development,1673406197

lotr,"Thanos wanted to die.

Titan was dead. The pieces of land were moving around the sky, there was no green to be seen nor any living thing that walked or flew in the air. The seas, rivers and lakes seemed like they boiled. 
Only because they did not listen to him. 

*We could have ended this. If you weren't all so stubborn, we could have ended this. All would live, children would finally taste bread and the sky would be clear. But you destroyed it. All of you!*

That was it. He tried to fight back then. No longer now. It is over.

""I am done."" he said, looking over the wasteland. ""Maybe death will be kinder.""

""I am not so certain. Death is too final, is it not?""

He jumped. 
""Who is that?""

""Patience, my friend."" Thanos froze. The voice tha spoke to him was ancient, wise...and melodic and beautiful. ""Rashness is what cost your kind life, did it not?""

The person who stood before him resembled a Terran. But only slightly. They were tall and majestic to look at. Long white hair and a the ageless face made them seem like a god of Terran myths. A specimen of physical perfection. But most impressive (and terrible) thing Thanos noticed were the eyes: eyes of flame and ash, yet holding wisdom beyond time and space itself. And why they? Thanos could not guess what this was: male or female. But it looked androgynous, as if, as if...

*As if body is just a garment they wear, not important to them.*

Thanos fell to his knees.

The Stranger smiled. ""Oh...we have had a bit of a problem, have we not?""

Tha voice tone sounded like that of a male. He, then.
""Who...who are you?"" was all he could ask. ""Are you...a god?""

Thanos never believed in them. Not until now.

The Stranger passed by him, touching him on his bald head. ""It could be put that way. I was here before all things. Before Asgardians, before your masters and before even the Cosmos itself."" he smiled again. ""*All* of Cosmos.""

Thanos narrowed his eyes. ""You...you knew this would happen?"" he straightened up and clenched his fist. ""You let this happen?""

""Pardon, Thanos. Do not be so angry, my friend. What could have I done?"" he shrugged. ""Nothing but observe. You were right: your plan of random elimination would have saved the planet, but they did not listen to you. If they did, they would be alive right now.""

He sat upon a rock. His fair appearance and...cleanness made everything around him seem pathetic, weak, filthy and ruined. As if a dead world already wasn't those things. Even the way he was keeping his right hand behind or in his robe made him look more...divine.

Thanos grunted when he realized what the Stranger said. *He knows my name.* ""No. They didn't listen to me.""

""And what you predicted came to pass."" The Stranger reached out with his hand and, in little sparks, a cup filled with a red liquid was formed. Thanos backed away again, glancing at it, expecting a poison.

""Do not be disturbed, Thanos."" he drank from one side of the cup. ""It is a drink from Earth, my friend. You would like it.""

Reluctantly, he took it and drank a bit of it. The taste was sweet, but odd. ""Are you from Earth?"" 

The Stranger waved in a dismissive gesture. He did it with such boredom, as if everything around him was ashes compared to him. ""That little world is like as an ant is to you. Sure, they are ants who can talk, so they sometimes get my attention because of that, but otherwise, no. It could not mean less to me.""

""Xandar?""

""Now, they are rats that might be useful at something, but still no.""

""Then who are you?"" Thanos asked.

""Ah."" he almost scoffed, but from his mouth it sounded elegant. ""A good question. I have always wondered how to explain when some of you ask me. In an as accurate way as possible, without your mind being unable to understand it.""

Thanos groaned. ""I don't like riddles!""

""Ah, good!"" the Stranger waved again. ""They cost me much a thing at one point. But, let us not talk about me, Thanos: how about you? What will you do now?""
Thanos eased his temper and looked around, seeing he chaos, ruin and death that was around him. He stood up, sighing. ""Die."" he said. ""I will stay and die here.""

""Oh, please."" he said. ""As I have told you: death is so...final. Why not use the time and resources you have for something else?""

""Resources?"" he looked back at his guest, with gnashes teeth. ""My home is gone.""

""You still have established property in other systems. You do not have nothing.""

""My home and people are gone!"" he mouthed, turning away. He had cousins all around the universe actually: Eternals. Thena was the closest one and he even had a brother, Eros. But his people who raised him and his home from childhood: they were gone. ""I have nothing else to live for.""

""Untrue."" the Stranger repeated and crossed his legs. ""For example, you could make sure nothing like this ever happens.""

Thanos turned. ""How?""

""Quite simply, actually."" he said and smiled. ""Just do it with your own hand: eliminate half of life in the universe and all peoples will live to see another day.""
He stared at him for a time. He said it as if he was talking about changing garments and then going to the toilet to release oneself. 

""You're insane."" he said honestly. ""There is no such power anywhere in the universe.""

""No!"" the Stranger stood up and smiled again. ""Incorrect! Again. It is possible: definitively so. In fact, as easy as drinking water. You just need a couple of things to fulfill the task and make it mean something.""

""Yes. I totally believe you."" he himself almost smiled, though he did not find it funny at all. ""Please, enlighten me: what is it?""

""The Infinity Stones."" 

Thanos froze at the mention that. The story as old as time: Infinity Stones, that came to be at the very beginning of the universe, representing its aspects. It was said even one stone would give an individual incredible power. Countless people looked for them, fewer obtained them: it is said in stories that even Celestials, the masters and constructors of Thanos' ancestors, looked for them and desired them. 

*There are six of them, he thought, Space, Time, Mind, Reality, Power and Soul.*

""Myths."" he sighed. ""Lies of ancient people. They never existed.""

""Really?"" the Stranger walked slowly and gracefully, not making even a small sound. ""Then why"" he reached out with his right hand. ""am I holding one in my hand?""

The Titan backed away. In the Stranger's hand was a small, beautiful stone, shinning with the light of yellow star. He felt it speak to him. Calling him. Thanos had no words. He just stared at it, then at the Stranger.

""You,"" the Stranger smiled. ""already understand that this might be the only way to do it: if you eliminate half of all life, the other half will thrive and live in prosperity. You thought of that yourself, did you not?""
They called him a madman, but he knew it was true: for life to survive at all, one half needs to die. And I was right, even just on my planet.

""It is a pity what happened to your world. It was beautiful. But there are other worlds out there, with children born, living and dying in hunger. Those worlds are just as beautiful as yours was. Would you want others to die too?""

He thought about it. Power to save everyone, by myself. He could not protect his own, but he could protect others. He looked at the stone, uncertain what he admired more: its beauty or the power it will bring. 

Then he remembered who held it.

""How?"" he pointed at him, accusing him. ""Who are you? Your name: now!""

The Stranger shrugged again. ""I told you: someone who wants to help you.""

""I might be desperate, but I am not a fool."" he hissed. ""What do you want?""

""You are insulting me, Thanos!"" he laid his hand upon his chest in protest. ""My desire is nothing more than for you to succeed. You see, our objectives are merged with one another.""

He tilted his head. ""Our objectives?""

""Yes. Yours, mine...and my master's, of course."" 
He blinked. This creature, standing in front of him, looking like a god in mortal world, had a master he served. ""Your master?""

""Indeed."" he smiled. ""Surprised? Oh, well, you see Thanos, the most impressive and gifted creatures recognize the greatness of those above them. My master, you see, is the Great Lord: Lord of Highest Places and the Master of Fates. A great power that belongs to **him** is rightfully **his** and the Great Throne is **his** dwelling place. I, on the other hand..."" he shrugged. ""You can think of me as **his** High Priest.""

""And what does your...lord want?"" Thanos asked with despise in his voice. He always hated religious fanatics. *This one is not a god, but surely presents himself as one.*

The Stranger looked at the moon closest to Titan. Even it was red as blood.
""We have enemies: my master and I. You might have heard of them and, if you have not, you will, under right, or, should I say, wrong circumstances. They call themselves the TVA."" his face twisted in disgust. ""A group of fools who think too highly of themselves and who stand as annoying insects at your neck.""

""What is their crime?""

""They are keeping some of my colleagues back. But more importantly, they are keeping my master at bay.""

Thanos chuckled. ""Who'd you call him: Lord of Highest Places? Right... If he is so powerful, how come he is held by that group?""

""A group can hold a great beast in chains. Does that mean they are greater than the beast?""

Thanos' smile disappeared. ""No.""

""Indeed. I would even say one only fears that which is greater than him. Nevertheless, in this they succeeded: others are out there and my master cannot take physical form in the Cosmos. Only I am able to step into reality and only I am able to touch it. So master chose me as *his* voice and *his* eye in the Cosmos.""

Thanos looked back at the Stone, his eyes basking in its glory.

""And this,"" the Stranger grinned. ""is how you will help me. Go and find them: the Infinity Stones. They are the very weapons keeping my master chained outside of the Cosmos or, as some of you would call it, the Multiverse. Do with them what you will: bring balance, bring peace, bring bread and breath to the entire universe and you will be its Saviour!"" he raised his finger to point out. ""There is one condition, only one thing you will need to do to return the favor to me: when you are done with your mission, you will destroy the Stones.""

Thanos' jaw dropped. ""What?""

""You heard me well: destroy them. All of them. Reduce them to dust and ash. That will be enough to accomplish my master's desires.""

The Stranger's gaze cut Thanos deeper and was pulling him more than any word that he has spoken, or anyone ever, for that matter. The fiery eyes burned: burned for real. They daunted him and made him feel like a rat. He only had strength to make one response.

""Will it work?"" he asked. ""Do they have the power to do it? Will I be able to do it?""

""Absolutely!"" the Stranger said, almost laughing.  ""Once you have the Stones, it will be quick and easy. All you will have to do is this!"" he snapped his fingers. ""And half of all life will end, just as you intended. The only condition I give you is to destroy them. That is all we ask of you.""

""I don't care for power."" Thanos said. ""I will not care for Stones after they served their purpose.""

""Perfect. Then it will not be hard of you to destroy them."" 

Thanos glared at the Stone again. He could feel its power, its strength, its energy touching his mind and sending thoughts as if they were words. He could save the entire universe. He would not be a madman like they called him. *They would call me a Saviour.*

He took it.

""There, you see!"" the Stranger clasped with his hands. ""Then it is all arranged! We shall both get what we wanted.""

""You still didn't give me your name.""

The Stranger raised his right hand. Only now Thanos noticed it was missing one, index finger.

""I have had a fair share of them, but..."" he smiled. Smiled like a devil.

lotr,"Not necessarily which film is the best in either its theatrical or extended form (we all know that’s Fellowship of the Ring heh) but which film do you think is most improved by the additions of the extended scenes?

As much as I love the extended edition of Fellowship of the Ring, the theatrical cut of that film is also a god tier, 10/10 film that’s pretty much perfect. The extended cut hues a bit closer to the book and has a looser structure and more measured pace that recalls the writing of Tolkien, but since the film is a masterpiece in either form I’m not sure it greatly improves the theatrical cut.

Similarly, I consider Return of the King to be the most hit and miss of the three films in both the theatrical and extended cut. I think the extended cut does ultimately improve the film, we get Saruman’s resolution (even if the scene isn’t great the character deserved closure), some really great scenes like the houses of healing, Aragorn mastering the palantir (basically the conclusion of his character’s arc) a great scene with Frodo and Sam at the crossroads of the fallen king, as well as some great scenes in Mordor fleshing out their journey. And while I know many debate Aragorn beheading the mouth of Sauron you can’t deny it makes his line “For Frodo” that much more impactful. The additional paths of the dead scenes are kind of dumb, but I won’t throw out the baby with the bathwater. 

But ya know, I think Two Towers is the film that most improves with the extended edition. If I had a big knock against the theatrical cut of that film it’s that Jackson spent so much time focusing on Aragorn, Rohan, and the Battle of Helm’s Deep, he ended up relegating the hobbits to supporting roles. The extended edition fills out both Merry and Pippin as well as Frodo and Sam’s subplots very nicely, while also fleshing out our boy Faramir is some ways that greatly improve his character and storyline.

Overall, my vote goes to The Two Towers.",Which LOTR film is most improved by its extended edition?,1673392776

While I expected the movies to not be able to include everything and skim over or completely omit some parts, I told myself that only the extended versions would do for my first watch of the series. 

I just finished The Fellowship of the Ring and saw that in the 3 hour and 48 minute runtime, strait up a HALF HOUR is credits. 

I thought “wow, I’ve always heard that even the regular versions are long at around three hours,” but I went to check the regular version and the credits there were only 8 minutes. 

Here I was expecting almost an hour more worth of content, and only get 20 minutes of extra content for watching the extended version???

We’re the extended versions a marketing scheme to get everyone to buy the series twice?

I feel gypped.

Is this common knowledge? Am I disappointed over nothing?

lotr,"-Sorry for bad translation- Fra to Eng.

I was 9 or 10 years old, it was in 2005 or 2006, I don't know exactly...

At that time, after school and during certain weekends, my friends and I used to go to a large park, near ruins, to play ""knights"", as they said.

No adults to watch us, no cell phones, no buildings, no roads, the immersion in our heroic marvelous universe was perfect.

There were about ten of us, boys and girls.  We had a lot of fun, I remember that the hours passed very quickly, too quickly.

In truth, we liked to mix all the universes that we liked at that time.

We had a lot of fun!  There were epic battles, knights equipped with wooden swords, magicians' staffs improvised with tree branches.

For the girls... Rather the princesses... The most miserable knights among us were transformed into magic horses, harnessed by jump ropes.

It was our universe, a mix of Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, our favorite cartoons and legends.

Me, I was a black magician, I was the bad guy.  My father, who is very handy, had made a magnificent magician's stick for me in a cherry branch during our holidays in Auvergne, enough to make all my friends jealous when I returned.

During a school trip, my older brother, meanwhile, had brought back a replica of the One Ring from Italy.

It wasn't mine but, although I wasn't allowed to use it, I really liked taking it on the sly to go and play in the park with my friends.

With this artifact in my possession, you can imagine that I was the most interesting.

Despite our young age, we liked to play in a very role-playing way, so I had become the most powerful, the strongest.

My friends were then particularly attracted by the precious.

And to avoid any effects of covetousness and envy by my comrades, I had crimped the One Ring at the end of my magician's staff.

So he was and would only be mine.

The battles were terrible, my magic was terrifying, growing, and the enemies bent under my power.

Until the day I stuck my stick in a cardboard shield.

In the heart of this park which was the scene of our confrontations, the ring had fallen.

It was only at the end of the battle, much too late, that I realized it...

Itt was then real tears that sprang from my body.

No more playing, it was no longer fun for anyone.

The cries of a child, who loses the object of the desire of all his comrades.

I had lost the Ring from Lord of the Rings!

Thus my friends helped me to search throughout the park, for hours, over several days, without ever finding the precious one.

That day, was it stolen from me?  I will never know.

A few years later, I returned to the park to remember the scenes of our heroic exploits, our merciless struggles, the countless losses, and the incessant marriages between knights and princesses, but also and above all to seek one last time the  'Ring.

I never found it, maybe it's still there?

Did someone, a child maybe, or worse an adult, find it before me?

They stole it from us.

He was mine. He is ours...

lotr,"I’m trying to make my own edits of the Hobbit and LOTR films, by ripping the films to my computer and using Adobe Premiere. I initially tried pirating copies, but they either have lower definition than I want or inconsistent subtitle formats for both Theatrical and Extended Editions. 

This has left me with the dvd choice of Blu-Ray or 4K to choose from, however, I don’t really know which one to choose, because I’ve heard there is good and bad aspects to both versions. I know that the Blu-Ray Extended version of Fellowship has the blue-green tint to it, that makes it wildly inconsistent with the Theatrical version, which would be a pain to dodge around in my editing process, but I also know that 4K has smoothed out a lot of the definition of certain shots, specifically LOTR. Though it seems to fix the tint issues for Fellowship, I’ve also noticed the 4K versions have made some other interesting color changes, such as making Smaug’s gold abrasively yellow. 

Ultimately I would like to hear everyone’s opinions on which version they prefer in order to help me make my decision. I did notice there was the Ultimate Collector’s Edition of the films, that had both Blu-Ray and 4K, which would solve my conundrum, but marked down, it’s still about $200.

Also, just a minor question, but do these dvds have the standard white subtitles? There have been versions of the films with small yellow subtitles that I don’t really like.","People of r/lotr, I call for aid",1673037638

lotr,"When Gandalf calls Pippin a “fool of a took” many may have realized he just insulted Pippins entire family. But it goes deeper if you analyze the language a bit more. He is saying in less words the following ‘you are the biggest fool amongst an entire family of fools’. And yes in the books he did have that sentiment. But it goes deeper if you go back to the hobbit when Gandalf was looking for the 14th member he was looking for a hobbit that may have a bit of the old Took in him. The Took’s were known for being more adventurous (foolish in the eyes of other habits), kinder and more inquisitive. While the Baggins family was more stead fast, polite and learned. Bilbo was very well read mind you. Gandalf had a love hate real with the took household. He admired their willingness to go off on random adventures and the fact that Pippin was the most likely probably was a bit too much. Also if you take a closer look into Gandalfs action,  Pippin was the only one to receive harsh words from directly from Gandalf aimed directly at him. Yes he calls Denethor a madman but he says it to Pippin. Now if you believe this is because Gandalf hated Pippin and merely tolerated him. Or if you feel that Gandalf consoling Pipping numerous times in battle of Pelennor Fields shows that Gandalf was just frustrated his inquisitiveness and recklessness. Remember there is way more behind that “fool of a took” line.

Fellowship is so good at getting you sucked into the world and learning the characters and there’s a ton of emotion too. Two Towers continues the momentum and emotion that part 1 left off on in such a great way, and the journey with the characters is so good and satisfying to watch that it rivals the first film. Return of the King knocks it out of the park with concluding the story; showing where all the characters end up and how the story ends up in a very melancholy way.

lotr,"Tldr; Which order should I re-read all the books for the 2nd time. 1st time was Hobbit, LOTR, Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales.

Alright my fellow lotr friends. I am very close to barking upon my second ever re-read of Tolkein's works, and I am having a bit of a problem deciding which order to do things in.

First, allow me to say that as a young man, I loved the PJ film adaptation, and I am saving my rewatch of the trilogy for AFTER this re-read. I thoroughly enjoyed the movies and some PS2 or PS3 game I played back in the day, always wanted to read the books. As I grew older, I delved more deeply into the lore of various fantasy worlds (Star Wars, Star Trek, The Witcher, The Last of Us, Horizon Zero Dawn etc..) but I was always saving the best for last.

I knew that consuming Tolkein would be an adventure on it's own, but the more I delved into little YouTube videos about why the Hawks didn't fly The Fellowship to Mordor, or why Gimli was so devastated in Moria, I started remembering all the questions I've heard, with answers I didn't fully understand over the years.

-Why did Gandalf survive the fight with the Balrog?
-Why does the ring slip off fingers?
-Do Elves live forever?
-Who is Sauron?
-Who built all these ruins you see throughout the movies?


Whenever I heard the answer to these questions, it left me with MORE questions. What is a Maiar? What do you mean the Eagles aren't just Eagles? 

I am delighted to tell you that I have, slowly but surely, attained the answers to my life-long questions through both YouTube videos, and good old fashioned Tolkein at his finest.

I began my journey with The Hobbit, after learning about Tolkein's life experiences, I found it fascinating reading through this book with my new knowledge.

Continued with the Lord of The Ring. WOW! What an amazing set of books, I can't even begin - and won't bother to bore you - with describing the beauty of the world, and the talent which Tolkein so lovingly wrote this amazing piece of masterful literature. Finally gave me my proper introduction to the story how it SHOULD be told.

I bravely followed this up with The Silmarillion. I was always intimidated by this series of stories the most. However with a little bit of YouTube summaries to help hash out the finer details, I would like to think I had a pretty good understanding of what happens in the three ages, from an overall perspective. I may not be quite to the level where I can always name names and events or places correctly, but I understand the Creation myth, I understand the First and Second age events overall and the Third Age just kinda flew by. I found The Silmarillion to be very well written (notnthat it means anything coming from me) and although st times a tad taxing, I did find the varied and intertwined stories to be compelling.

Now I am nearly 2/3 of the way through The Unfinished Tales. Tying up the loose ends I have always wanted to know about. I loved the tale of Turin, I feel I am getting substantially better at reading Tolkein and understanding his flow at this point. I am cherishing the last bit of Tolkein's tales before I have finished.

Now, the re-read order I am considering is beginning with  The Silmarillion, The Hobbit, LOTR and any Unfinished Tales I want to hear again.

Should I go in this order? Or should I cut right to the juice and go straight back in to the whimsical nature of The Hobbit I've been missing these past 30 years of my life.

One thing I'm curious about, I don't recall from the books, and I haven't found an answer searching this forum, but this particular name I mention above.

I understand the implications of what ""Stormcrow"" represents and I believe Grima also makes the same implication in the movies.  Was Gandalf referred this way in Rohan and in Edoras in the years prior to him arriving in Edoras with the members of the Fellowship (absent Samwise and Frodo) or is this only a title thrust on him by Théoden while under the influence of Saruman?

When riding into Rohan, as Gimli says ""you'd find more cheer in a graveyard"" but I'm not sure if this is a product of the displeasure of seeing Gandalf come to town, a product of the current scenario in Rohan, or both?

Additionally, when counseling Théoden, at least in the film, the king gives a tepid glance at Gandalf as Gandalf counsels him.

But Anglachel has always stood out to me as having a very sword and sorcery feel. Much more than the rest of The Legendarium. This is from [a rather long essay I wrote](https://www.blackgate.com/2018/04/02/tolkiens-magic-sword-anglachel-2/) on Anglachel:

TURIN SPOILER AHEAD (Though you should know Turin's tale if you're reading this)

 'While magic swords are common in the modern fantasy/RPG world, they  were rare and prized in Middle Earth. Anglachel could cut through iron  and it glowed with a pale fire, which truly marked it as a wondrous  blade. It was also sentient, though that is not revealed until the end  of its tale. Horrified to discover that Niniel was really his sister,  Turin addressed the sword:

&gt;“Hail Gurthang! No lord or loyalty dost thou know, save  the hand that wieldeth thee. From no blood wilt thou shrink. Wilt thou  therefore take Túrin Turambar, wilt thou slay me swiftly?’ “

And from the blade rang a cold voice in answer:

&gt;“Yea, I will drink thy blood gladly, that so I may forget  the blood of Beleg my master, and the blood of Brandir slain unjustly. I  will slay thee swiftly.”

By mentioning Brandir’s unearned death and speaking of loyalty to  Beleg, Gurthang’s words indicate that it wasn’t animated by the essence  of Eol. The sword wants to allow Turin to right his wrongs by letting  him kill himself. This is quite different from the dark malevolence of  Elric’s Stormbringer, which delights in stealing the souls of the albino  prince’s friends. Stormbringer is revealed to be a demon, and it speaks  to Elric at the end of the epic saga, “I was a thousand times more evil  than thou!”

However, if we dismiss Eol’s dark character as the source of  Anglachel’s intelligence, there is no other indication of where the  sword drew its abilities from. We could infer it was a combination of  Eol’s craftsmanship and the meteorite iron, but that’s just pure  guesswork.'

I really want to start reading, have attempted a couple times, but I’m not sure if one of the reasons I’m having a hard time is because the “bigness” of the whole story at once is too much.

I’m toying with the idea of purchasing the paperbacks divided out if I can find a good price but not sure if it’s a moot point.

lotr,"  Sigh. What is there to say about *The Two Towers* other than “What a fucking mess.” 

At least with *Fellowship*, you can pick apart the elements that Jackson, Boyens &amp; Walsh “improved” and explain why they feel so disrespectful to the books. There are also moments (a few) that genuinely *feel* like Tolkien.

This film is mostly just 8 hours of stupid crammed into a 4-hour bag. It’s impossible to truly analyze what’s wrong with this film because so little is right. In that regard, I’ll just stick with the broadest of strokes.

People in this forum often challenge me as to why I dislike the PJ films so much, so, by request, here’s a breakdown of what I find so offensive about the Extended Edition of *The Two Towers…*

*•* *•* *•*

*:03 Gandalf &amp; The Balrog fall for an hour…*  
 Okay, I promised not to nitpick but I kinda can’t resist. I know Gandalf said, “Long time I fell, and he fell with me,” but there’s a difference between “A long time” and “Holy shit, still falling.” Gandalf and the Balrog fall for 71 seconds. For the record, that’s a fall of over 15 miles. I *think* that’s probably excessive.

*:04 Sam &amp; Frodo…*  
 I will admit, now that PJ&amp;W are forced to treat them as main characters, Frodo and Sam are suddenly a lot closer to their book personalities. Without all the Important Characters to look after them, PJ has no choice but treat Sam &amp; Frodo like adults. Sam is capable, and Frodo is no longer a cringing coward, paralyzed by fear, and it’s refreshing. For this first bit, before JB&amp;W start “fixing” the plot, this actually feels like *Lord of the Rings*.

*:14* *Sméagol promises nothing…*  
 An incredibly important moment JB&amp;W either didn’t understand or didn’t care about. Sméagol has to **speak his promise to the Ring**. That’s how the magic, the control, the prophecy of it works. 

“Sméagol will swear never, never, to let Him have it. Never! Sméagol will save it,” and “I will serve the master of the Precious!”

Sméagol **must** say these things (or something close to them) to build for himself the clever trap that forces his own doom. The Ring compels the completion of both of these oaths. In the film all he says is “I will serve the master…” but that’s nothing.

*:18 Orc noses and Aragorn’s intuition…*  
 Not only can orcs climb down walls once per movie, they can also scent men an entire day’s run away (once per trilogy, because they never smell anyone who might surprise or overtake them again). And then Aragorn *instantly* knows the orcs have scented them! 

*:20 “And the union of the Two Towers…”*  
 STOP putting the fucking title into dialogue, Jackson, you hack! It is completely stupid and unnecessary. Of course this is followed by the most absurdly arch order to burn Fangorn that Christopher Lee could possibly contrive. *This thing will be your undoing; let’s say it out loud to make sure everyone knows you’re destroying all the trees!*

*:22 Burn this pointless village! We need an action scene!*  
 It really is so dumb. Yes, Saruman was able to raise the wild hillmen and the Dunlendings, but we didn’t need to waste the screen time watching this village being attacked.

It is also a really ham-fisted way to introduce characters to show Éomer finding Théodred (who was supposed to have been 41, BTW, not this pretty boy) just to take him home to die. We shouldn’t be meeting these characters until our leads meet these characters. It’s just crappy storytelling.

*:25 The Grima &amp; Théoden Show…*  
 There’s a part of me that really thinks Jackson was playing these characters as comic relief. Both Théoden and Wormtongue are presented in such ridiculous, over-the-top, comic-opera extremes he cannot possibly have wanted this to taken seriously. Here’s Théoden from the book:

“Upon it sat a man so bent with age that he seemed almost a dwarf; but his white hair was long and thick and fell in great braids from beneath a thin golden circlet set upon his brow. In the centre upon his forehead shone a single white diamond. His beard was laid like snow upon his knees; but his eyes still burned with a bright light, glinting as he gazed at the strangers.”

Compare that to the old man who cannot even open his eyes and speaks only to Wormtongue in unintelligible mumbles. Again, JB&amp;W have proven they have literally zero subtelty. Every element must be heightened to the point of utmost stupidity. The Rohirrim are a proud, warrior people. Is it plausible that they would still follow a doddering old man who could neither stand nor speak? Everything about this version of Théoden and Wormtongue is ludicrous.

Then, when Éomer steals Gandalf’s thunder about Grima’s price, Jackson ACTUALLY HAS WORMTONGUE LOOK AT ÉOWYN! Is this a student film? 

Next, guards come to beat the crap out of Éomer. Who are these guys? Are they being paid by Wormtongue? They certainly wouldn’t act like this simply on his say. Again, for this rotten kingdom ploy to work, Théoden has to be the puppet, not a slobbering pile of suet.

*:31 The Riders of Rohan attack in the dumbest possible way…*  
 Guess the orc’s noses don’t work at night because they failed to smell horsemen and horses. I recognize there wasn’t the screen time for the Riders to harry and surround the orc band as they do in the book, but having them display even rudimentary knowledge of tactics for attacking from horse would have been nice. Instead, they just blunder in. At night when the orcs have the advantage of visibility. And use bows at close range with their own guys running around. But, yeah, what did I expect?

*:40 Treebeard kills Grishnak…*  
 I *really* hate this introduction of Treebeard. Not because it isn’t what happens in the book, but because it’s completely out of character. It is an incredibly *hasty* act, and gives the wrong impression of how Ents behave (or how Ents *should* behave) right out of the gate. Immediately, he involves himself in the affairs of the other races.

Yes, Treebeard hates orcs, but in the book he suspects Merry and Pippin of being orcs and waits to decide. This version of Treebeard doesn’t even jibe with the one we see later at the Entmoot who is so passive he has to be tricked into attacking Saruman.

*:42 The Dead Marshes…*  
 The Marshes the way it was written in the book is so much more cinematic than what ended up onscreen, it’s bizarre that Jackson changed it. In the original, the initial entry takes place after dusk, and the lights (which are referenced in the film but never seen; maybe an effect never got finished?) are all around. The faces are much more dimly visible and hypnotic. Then the wraith flies over and the lights go out. It’s a *great* visual. 

Instead, JB&amp;M had to have their second zombie moment, and instead of being glamoured, Frodo falls in and is assaulted by shrieking undead faces and it’s all shtick we’ve seen a hundred times. PJ did it better in *The Frighteners*.

Immediately after this, Frodo lies there masturbating the Ring. Because even the draw of the Ring had to be loud and stupid. Instead of fighting until almost the end, we’re literal screen *hours* away from Mt. Doom and Frodo has already lost the battle. IT’S TOO FUCKING MUCH, PETE!

*1:05 The Elven cloaks are from Harry Potter…*  
 Of *course* Sam falls off a cliff near the Black Gate and of *course* two Easterlings come to investigate. Frodo wraps them in his Elven cloak and the observant Easterling stops three literal inches from the hem of the cloak and yet, in broad daylight, cannot see them. It is so over-the-top dumb I was expecting Frodo to have grown a lightning bolt-shaped scar when he finally opened the cloak (which has become a much larger molded stone covering).

*1:10 Merry &amp; Pippin are still idiots, and Old Man Willow is in the wrong film…*  
 Why do Merry &amp; Pippin have to have a scrambling pratfall argument about Merry drinking the Ent draught. Can’t Merry just… drink the fucking water…? Do we have to *witness* them growing, complete with gassy sound effects? 

And then here’s Old Man Willow, fresh from The Old Forest, just in time to make it seem like Treebeard isn’t even in charge of the trees *in his own Enthouse*, much less the rest of the forest. Because heaven forfend we go more than 4 minutes without a forced, unmotivated action sequence.

*1:19 The scuffle before Théoden’s throne…*  
 It’s been five minutes. Time for ACTION! Instead of allowing Gandalf to command the room, as he does in the book, the men of Théoden’s house rush in for a quick fistfight with Aragorn and the boys while Gandalf *actually casts the spell* to release Théoden. The subtle elegance of the book, *did Gandalf use magic or just psychology to get Théoden out of his chair?* We can’t have that. 

No, in Jackson’s world, Gandalf has to actually say “I release you from this spell!” But that’s not enough! No, he has to light the room with his white cloak, and apply electro-shock with his staff, jolting Théoden in his chair Once! Twice! Thrice! Complete with sound effects and a cutaway to Saruman flying across the room!

It is. So. Dumb.

In this world, Théoden is a barbarian king and wants to kill Wormtongue, depriving him of the delicious guile he displays in offering Wormtongue mercy by offering to let him ride into battle. Then, Jackson sets up Aragorn to immediately undermine Théoden’s renewed authority by stopping him from exercising his vengeance. The only person in this scene with motivations that make sense is Wormtongue.

*1:30 Helm’s Deep is a stupid idea…*  
 Nothing that happens in Jackson’s film after Gandalf Abracadabras Théoden makes sense. In the book, he counsels Rohan to make war against Saruman so the threat of Isengard will not be on the flanks of Gondor. They ride out, hoping to reach the Ford of Isen before the defense there has faltered, but they are too late. Word reaches them of the rout, and they fall back to Helm’s Deep at Gandalf’s urging.

In the movie, they spend a long time burying Théodred (whom the audience never knew, and there was no narrative gain to having alive at all), after which Théoden refuses to ride to war, and instead heads directly for Helm’s Deep (with *all* his people), which Gandalf thinks is a terrible idea. This is just pointless meddling with the story to add needless conflict between Gandalf &amp; co. and Théoden, and it makes the plot pointless. 

Apparently, in this movie, there are no keeps in Dunharrow? Why would Théoden then not simply head for Minas Tirith? Wormtongue makes a point of telling Saurman the road to Helm’s Deep is dangerous and slow. No one has any clear motivations at this point; it’s just a bunch of word salad designed to get to a huge battle, which is Jackson’s only goal for this film.

*1:35 Aragorn absolutely leads Éowyn on pointlessly…*  
 In the book, Aragorn is incredibly careful not to flirt with Éowyn. He recognizes that she wants him, and he gently, but firmly, shuts her down. It’s noble and honest. A bit cold-hearted, but he is part Elven (well, in the book; Viggo has a beard so Jackson’s Aragorn is plainly 100% human, but whatever). 

Here, Jackson has Aragorn flirting with absolute intent, just to say later, “oh, sorry dummy, my heart is taken.” It’s a shitty bro-move, and unworthy of the character.

*1:45 The Hobbits are idiots again…*  
 Sam &amp; Frodo’s brief time of being capable adults is all done, because now there are Important Humans about. While in the book, they realize Faramir’s men are near and hide, leaping out to make an impossible stand and thus impressing Faramir and his men, PJ has them bumbling into Faramir, falling on their asses and begging for mercy. No bold bravery here, just pathetic little people.

*1:55 PJ Sends in THE WARG RIDERS!*  
 What is there really to say about this stupid, pointless warg rider attack? Obviously, JB&amp;W felt they had gone too long without an Action Sequence! so we get this. It does nothing to forward the story, depletes Théoden’s forces to a comically small number, and inserts the so, so absurd “Aragorn is dead! He fell off a cliff!” beat. Everything about this is wrong.

The whole sequence ends with Wormtongue saying “But my lord, there is no such force!” only to be shown Saruman’s army arrayed below, so there must be some secret hidden entrance into Isengard because somehow Wormtongue didn’t pass or see these “tens of thousands” of orcs on the way in.

*2:10 Elrond prophesies Arwen’s ending…*  
 I actually really appreciate them including Arwen’s miserable end from the Appendices; a lot of people never read them, and fail to understand how few happy endings there are in Tolkien’s world. Most roads lead to sorrow. My only complaint is that it is so cheesily done, with Hugo Weaving chewing all the scenery and spitting it right into the camera. With even the slightest touch of subtelty, this moment woulda been beautiful.

Then, of course, it all goes to shit with Galadriel’s telepathic infodump (to Elrond, I guess?) for those who haven’t been following along. 

And, of course, Anborn knows Théoden has taken his people to Helm’s Deep even though there’s literally no way they could know this. Also, apparently, Osgiliath *just fell*; in his flashback, Denethor tells Faramir “but for you, this city would still be standing.” 

Weird because Osgiliath was ruined 500 years earlier, and looks it, and Faramir doesn’t seem quite that old. Gondor had retaken both banks about 20 years earlier, but then lost the east bank a year before the movie. Not sure what this memory is of them reclaiming Osgiliath. Just an opportunity for Denethor to be a dick.

*2:30 Faramir is just another thug…*  
 Tell me again how Peter Jackson does not have complete contempt for Tolkien’s characters? Faramir is *different* from Boromir. That is the entire point. That is why Denethor despises him. Faramir has studied with Gandalf, has a mind for history and strategy, and Faramir is not arrogant. But Jackson can’t abide subtlety or shades of grey, or the Faramir, who encounters the ring and turns it away, saying “Not if I found it on the highway would I take it.”

*This* Faramir lets his guards kick the shit out of Gollum. This Faramir is shifty and untrustworthy. This Faramir declares the Ring will go to his father, even *knowing* Denethor would become a tyrant if given it. Because in Peter Jackson’s universe, the Ring would already have won and Frodo been killed for it because *all* men are *instantly* susceptible.

Following this, Aragorn finally rejoins the movie already in progress, having taken a pointless little holiday in the river Isen.

*2:45 The Fucking Goddamned Elven Archers…*  
 No. No, Peter. You do not get to ignore *everything* about Tolkien’s lore and go unscathed. The elves Do. Not. Fight. This. Fight. For all the reasons you ignored, and everyone else already knows. The elves are leaving the fighting to men. Period. Fuck you and Fran and Philippa for deciding to include them. Absolutely no. The Last Alliance was the LAST. You DO NOT get to make a NEW one.

Worse, they are from “Elrond of Rivendell,” but they’re archers of Lorien, so it doesn’t make any logical sense either.

SO much is so dumb about this battle sequence. Relegating Gimli to comic relief status by putting him on the battlement, where he would never be in the first place. How easily the wall is overrun. The orcs being so much stronger than men as opposed to relying on strength in numbers. The orc running with the Olympic flame. The breach in the wall being replaced by a huge explosion (with Aragorn on top of it, naturally). Gimli jumping directly onto a field of upraised spears and missing all of them. The archers charging, instead of, y’know, shooting arrows. The Dwarf tossing. The ridiculous giant siege ladders going up fully loaded.

The goddamned shield. How did any of you ever forgive Legolas and the goddamned shield?

*2:58 The Ents decide not to go to war…*  
 I’m guessing primarily because they decided yes in the book. And, of course, because no one gets to be heroic but the heroes, so we have to set it up that Pippin *directly* leads the Ents to war.

*3:11 Faramir drags Frodo to Osgiliath…*  
 Just the cherry on top of making Faramir a myopic dickhole in this version. He sends the Hobbits off to Denethor, which means he *was* resisting the power of the Ring. He didn’t try to take it for himself. He is *choosing* to send it to someone he knows will do terrible things with it. But, yeah, JB&amp;W didn’t make any important changes to the characters at all…

*3:16 Gandalf returns with Éomer…*  
 So, the Elven archers (all of whom seem to have died by this point) were able to get here on foot from Lorien *before* Gandalf and the remainder of the Riddermark were able to arrive? Given that, in Jackson’s version, Gandalf brings these guys rather than the Huorns, this really seems like far too little, far too late. Especially since *none* of these horses would survive the charge down that hill.

Also, are both Éomer and Gandalf stupid enough to just charge into an entire wall of set pikes? Seriously, this is cavalry 101. Do Not Ride Into Pikes. Yeah, the sun comes up right behind the charge, but the pikes are still set. It’s SO DUMB.

*3:20 Frodo shows the Goddamned Ring to the Goddamned Nazgûl…*  
 If this isn’t proof that Jackson does not understand the story he is supposed to be telling, I don’t know what is. Right here, the movie is over (again). Frodo (now magically atop a tower) shows the Ring to one of the Nine. Sam saves Frodo, Frodo flips out and threatens Sam with Sting, Faramir shoots the fell beast with an arrow, and the Nazgûl **FLIES AWAY?!?**

None of that matters. Sauron now *KNOWS*, not suspects, not fears, but *KNOWS* the Ring is in Osgiliath, being carried by a Hobbit. The rest of the Nine would *instantly* descend on Osgiliath and tear it apart until the Hobbits were found. Even if that somehow failed to happen, it means ~~Gandalf’s~~  Aragorn’s feint at the Black Gates wouldn’t work. Sauron would know the Ring wasn’t with them. This moment completely and irretrievably breaks anything that comes after.

Then, in what I’m certain is a middle finger to people like me, Sam cries, “It’s all wrong! We shouldn’t even be here.”

That’s right, Sam. It is. And you shouldn’t.",Why I Hate the Films: Part II; The Two Towers (Extended),1672643830
lotr,"People in this forum often ask why I dislike the PJ trilogy so much. They assume it’s because things got cut; I get lectured about how you can’t translate an epic like LotR word-for-word, and I understand that. I’m a filmmaker. I never expected we would have Bombadil, or every moment of the trilogy represented.

What I didn’t expect was Jackson’s absolute disdain for the actual soul of the trilogy itself. When I watch these films, I see a lot of great work; the art department, costume department and makeup department obviously wanted to make *Lord of the Rings*, and, largely, they did a fantastic job. 

The script, however, displays obvious contempt for the characters and the world in which they live. At one point, in the Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens audio commentary for *Two Towers,* Boyens says, “Look, our version is just better!”

It's plain that was their attitude about the entire story, and it makes me sad. It makes me angry. Peter Jackson had all the tools at his disposal to do it right, and he pissed it away. No one in my lifetime will have this opportunity again.

I’m not interested in changing anyone’s mind, and you can save your “But dude, Legolas shield-surfing the stairs is AWESOME and I heard the book ends on a total downer!” comments as well. Downvote away. I’m not gonna stop saying the films are terrible, and I honestly don’t care about your arguments to the contrary. This just gives me an easy way to answer *why*. 

I have a lot of issues with the actual filmmaking choices Jackson made; photography, lighting, editing; but that isn’t what this is about. This is about *story*. Frankly, there are a million elements I could tear apart (i.e. *Dayum it’s bright as day in the caverns under the Misty Mountains… no wonder Bilbo found the Ring*), but I’m trying not to be too picky and focus solely on the things that really make me gnash my teeth. By request, here’s a breakdown of what I find so offensive about the Extended Edition of *Fellowship of the Ring…*

*•* *•* *•*

*:03 Elrond in the front lines…*  
 Why is Elrond literally the only warrior in the Last Alliance who couldn’t afford a helmet? This makes me crazy. It’s a little thing but it’s a good indicator of the kind of senseless cheats the next 12 hours are gonna be full of.

*:17 Gandalf prat-falls around Bag End…*  
 Right out of the gate, Jackson begins undermining Gandalf. These aren’t Tolkien’s characters, they are two-dimensional Fantasy Film Archetypes straight from Central Casting. Gandalf has to be a doddering old man because that’s what old men do; they walk into chandeliers and whack their heads on low door frames. Gandalf isn’t a demigod, he’s your absent-minded old uncle. That grinding sound is Tolkien spinning.

*:19 Bilbo hasn’t told Frodo his plan to leave…*  
 The choice for Bilbo to have not revealed his plan to Frodo is very odd. It makes Frodo seem gullible, and it also seems like Bilbo doesn’t trust Frodo, having not taken him into his confidence. It’s just extra story baggage that isn’t really true to the characters.

*:26 Gandalf is surprised by Bilbo’s party trick…*  
 Poor Gandalf. Even though he knows Bilbo better than probably anyone, even though he has plenty of time to see what Bilbo is doing, he is somehow caught unawares by Bilbo putting on the ring. In the book, of course, he adds a flash and bang to make it seem like a trick to mask Bilbo’s vanishing. But poor old movie Gandalf just isn’t that sharp so he sits there like a dunce.

*:27 “What about this ring of yours, is that staying too?”*  
 In the book, it is plain Gandalf approves of the party and the spectacle to make it easier for Bilbo to part with the Ring. That’s the entire plan. For some inexplicable reason, in Jackson’s universe, this is the first time the subject has come up?! So now, in the minute before Bilbo leaves, Gandalf has to browbeat him into parting with the Ring? Why? What narrative purpose does this *possibly* serve other than making Gandalf infinitely less wise than he is in the books? In this version, why wouldn’t Bilbo react as if Gandalf was trying to defraud him?

*:31* *Gandalf almost picks up the Ring…*  
 Had Jackson left the Ring on the floor to be encountered by Frodo when he walked in, it would actually have been a nice, relatively subtle indicator that Gandalf was afraid to touch it. Instead, we get this little waking nightmare with the flash on The Eye. At this point, in Jackson’s world, Gandalf should have no doubt, or, at the very least, much stronger suspicions that this is The One. At this point, it is cruel, criminal and negligent for Gandalf to allow Frodo to take it. But this is doddering Granddad Gandalf, so, of course he just backs away in fear and says “Keep it safe little dude.”

*:37 Gandalf is terrified and scares Frodo to death…*  
 I understand the drive to make the narrative more urgent by drastically condensing the length of time Gandalf is gone from The Shire, and the time Frodo has to plan, but having him return, losing his shit and literally jumping at shadows is just incredibly out of character. 

It also makes it completely irrational for Gandalf to then go off again. If he’s that afraid, he would never leave Frodo and the Ring. He even departs in the same direction as Sam and Frodo, and just abandons them in the forest instead of taking them with him to Rivendell and going from there to see Saruman. In condensing the timeline, Jackson, Boyens and Walsh have completely thrown out the logic.

*:48 Gandalf trusts Saruman…*  
 Oh simple, trusting, doddering Gandalf. In the book, Gandalf *never* trusts Saruman. He only goes to him at Saurman’s request, and even then, gives him no information. In the film, of course, Gandalf lays everything out like a simpleton. Then Saurman REVEALS TO GANDALF THAT HE HAS A PALANTÍR?!? Why would he ever do this? It is an instant admission of guilt and betrayal.

Then we have this stupid, *stupid* wizard battle. Ninety interminable seconds of Old Man WWF that ends with the most ridiculous spun-by-wires scene ever. This is the polar opposite of how magic works in Tolkien’s world. I am embarrassed for this film.

*:53 Frodo finally officially meets Merry &amp; Pippin…*  
 This is a huge thing that most people who love the films simply gloss over, but it changes the tone and tenor of everything that comes after. Before this, we have seen Merry &amp; Pippin precisely twice; once, being idiots stealing a firework to set it off themselves at the party, and again dancing on a table at The Ivy Bush.

Now we meet them stealing vegetables from Farmer Maggot, and Pippin says, “Merry! It’s Frodo Baggins!”

I don’t know why this change made sense to JB&amp;W, but in this version *Merry &amp; Pippin barely know Frodo*. They are, at best, casual, small-town acquaintances. They are absolutely *not* his best and oldest friends. Then, suddenly, they’re all just… together. But there is *absolutely no reason Merry &amp; Pippin would have gone with Frodo*. Yes, they’re mischievous young Hobbits interested in adventure, but this is actual pants-pissing danger. Absent the relationship that’s established in the book, nothing that follows between the four of them makes any sense at all. 

*:57 The Black Rider actually catches them in the forest…*  
 These Black Riders are so much more aggressive and unafraid of anything than they are in the books. One of them has already cut down the gate guard at the Brandywine Bridge in a quick shot. In the book, they are reticent to declare open war on The Shire and the Downlands. They avoid Maggot’s dogs; they attack the Prancing Pony by stealth. These Black Riders would just kill everyone and sift the bodies.

Setting that aside, at this moment, the movie is over. They are actually caught, in the open, by a Rider. Frodo manages to escape, at 3 ½ feet tall, running from a horse. The Rider doesn’t cut them down, doesn’t grab Frodo and pull him over his saddle. He just flails around. This moment is aggressively stupid.

*1:02 Frodo puts on the Ring at the Prancing Pony…*  
 As far as we know, this is the first time Frodo has ever put on the Ring, and instantly, he’s in nightmareland and Sauron INSTANTLY sees him. In the book, the real world fades a bit and hearing is sharpened; had this happened every time Bilbo put on the Ring, obviously, he wouldn’t have used it.

*1:03 Aragorn and Narsil…*  
 Now we’re getting to the point where JB&amp;W have fucked up the opening of the story so much that things are beginning to unravel, and will require a lot of pointless patchwork later on. Aragorn draws a sword here, but it isn’t Narsil. But why would it be? There’s no letter from Gandalf, and Butterbur barely knows him, so there’s no reference to the sword that was broken to give Aragorn his bonafides. 

Frodo simply… takes him at his word, which makes Frodo really dumb. In fact, in this version of the story, there’s no way Aragorn could have known to be looking out for the Hobbits in the first place. Gandalf abandoned them and rode hell-for-leather to Saruman, so who told Aragorn they were coming?

*1:04 The Riders assault on Bree…*  
 And in another Jackson “enhancement,” the Riders literally ride down an entire section of wall, crushing Old Harry underneath. Ahhh, subtlety. But after declaring themselves in this way, they don’t ransack the rest of the inn? They just… leave…?

*1:10 Saruman takes orders from Sauron…*  
 Here we see Saruman getting direct marching orders from Sauron. So we lose all the complexity of Saruman being a competing power and instead he’s simply a minion of Sauron. Makes everything that follows much more two-dimensional, and it’s unfair to Saruman whose arrogance assured him he was in control at all times. Clunky, clumsy, simple-minded.

*1:11 Aragorn hands out blades…*  
 Aragorn hands out four Hobbit-sized blades he just happened to be carrying. So not only did he magically know the Hobbits were coming, he magically knew *how many*, even though there’s no reason in the world Merry &amp; Pippin are still following.

*1:14 Aragorn fucks off and leaves the Hobbits to die…*  
 Everything that could be wrong with this scene is wrong. Aragorn goes to “have a look around,” and can’t be bothered to come back until everything is fucked. They are *supposed* to have a fire. Aragorn builds it in the dell at the top where it won’t be seen from below. The entire space in the film is much too small. 

The description in the books is artful; figures of dread and terror.

“Over the lip of the little dell, on the side away from the hill, they felt, rather than saw, a shadow rise, one shadow or more than one. They strained their eyes, and the shadows seemed to grow. Soon there could be no doubt: three or four tall black figures were standing there on the slope, looking down on them. So black were they that they seemed like black holes in the deep shade behind them. Frodo thought that he heard a faint hiss as of venomous breath and felt a thin piercing chill. Then the shapes slowly advanced.”

In the film four (then five) brightly-lit guys in black cloaks advance to so close to the cowering Hobbits it’s comical. Then, because every non-human in Jackson’s film must be Less Than Aragorn, Frodo just lies back terrified. He doesn’t call out the name of Elbereth (he doesn’t even know any lore, apparently), he doesn’t stab the Witch King, he doesn’t do anything but piss himself. Then, finally, Aragon appears in slow-motion with his generic sword and a torch (lit from what fire? Also, not a brand, and actual *torch*), *sets fire to two of them and actually fences with the others until they fucking flee because he’s just* ***that*** *badass*. Then the INCREDIBLY STUPID torch-throw that ignites the fifth Rider which then flees as well. 

This scene is just so *wrong*, so utterly and completely **not** from Tolkien’s books it would be comical if it wasn’t so painful.

*1:18 Shit-covered Lurtz and the Uruk-Hai*…  
 Yes, the Uruks had been bred to be bigger and less light-sensitive than regular orcs, but this is just absolutely ridiculous. They still only survive by strength in numbers, and trying to make a “super-orc” secondary villain is a cheeseball move.

*1:19 Arwen…*  
 Jesus, this… I get it. There aren’t a lot of women in LotR, and here’s Glorfindel just kinda hanging around not doing anything, so why not replace him? But this meet-cute moment with the sword in the forest, and Aragorn just chewing up the Athelas and mashing it into Frodo’s wound, it’s all so ham-handed. It’s like you told the story to an 8-year-old and then asked him to tell it back to you.

And, of course, because Frodo is just baggage in this movie, he cannot ride alone. He has to ride with Arwen so she can have this “Come and claim him!” moment. But we lose Frodo refusing the summons of the Riders, one of the most important moments of Frodo’s stoicism before reaching Rivendell. Instead, he’s just afraid and useless. 

Then Arwen calls the flood rather than Elrond releasing it, but she does it while they are *still in the water*. And doddering old Gandalf doesn’t even get credit for the horses in the foam.

*1:30 Elrond plots to manipulate Frodo…*  
 Elrond and Gandalf spy on Frodo and Sam, and it is obvious that Elrond expects Frodo to carry the Ring away from Rivendell. Frodo’s single most important moment of agency in the entire story is taken from him. Also, we see that Gandalf somehow recovered his staff from Saruman, but at this point, who cares about continuity?

*1:38 The Council of Idiots…*  
 Ohmigod this scene. What was originally a discussion of events and a council of war debated among the various representatives of the free peoples turns into Boromir almost taking the ring, Gandalf reciting the verse complete with Surround Sound &amp; Lighting Effects, Gimli trying to destroy it with his axe and everyone squabbling like children. 

JB&amp;W took something reasoned and intelligent and made it loud and stupid. I want to punch this scene in the teeth. I’m glad they removed Bilbo, he deserves better. Then they end it by fucking up Frodo’s most important moment so that he has to shout “I will take the Ring!” three times. No, quiet dignity and strength is only for Aragorn, silly Hobbit!

Followed by the awful “My sword! My bow! My axe” scene, because, in this version, they’re just volunteering rather than being chosen. And Merry &amp; Pippin, now **REALLY HERE FOR NO REASON**, declare they will have to be bound in a sack to keep them from going.

Then… oh god, then… they actually wrote down the fucking title and *made Hugo Weaving say it.* “You will be the Fellowship of the Ring!”

*1:52 Gimli suggest going through Moria…*  
 Of all the changes made by JB&amp;W this one confuses me the most. Moria was a huge Dwarven city, Balin decided to retake Moria over thirty years before the Fellowship set out, and he has been presumed dead for decades. There has been no word from Moria, but Gimli seems to think it’s viable and operating. “My cousin Balin would give us a royal welcome.”

Gimli being ignorant of Moria’s status while both Gandalf and Aragorn fear that it is a death trap is a really bizarre story choice. It makes no sense logically, and it doesn’t make any sense structurally. I can’t figure out why they thought this was “better” in any way. Even Saruman (Sauron’s proxy as a villain all through this trilogy) seems to know there’s a Balrog waiting in Moria.

*1:55 Saruman can do anything…*  
 Saruman seems to have no limits in this film. He uses the crows as spies. He controls the weather. He causes a landslide in the pass of Caradhras. He calls lightning from hundreds of leagues away… it’s just too much. This isn’t how magic works in Tolkien’s world, but we’re not in Middle-Earth, we’re in a mediocre D&amp;D adventure where the bad guy knows *everything*. Then Gandalf defers to Frodo, who has no idea what the options are or what they mean. 

*2:02 Gandalf can’t open the doors…*  
 Doddering old Gandalf can’t even come up with the answer. Frodo, the sudden riddle-master (it isn’t a riddle at all, but whatever) has to figure this out? Why did they even bring Gandalf? Once they get in to what is obviously an unlit, disused, long-abandoned entrance, Gimli, who is plainly delusional, says, “Soon, Mr. Elf, you will enjoy the fabled hospitality of the Dwarves. Roaring fires! Malt beer! Red meat off the bone!” It makes NO SENSE.

Imagine having to go through the remains of Fukushima to get somewhere. You know there was an accident, and people went in thirty years ago to do cleanup but there has been zero communication. Why, upon reaching the desolate, abandoned outskirts, would you announce how great it will be?

*2:13 Pippin knocks every piece of metal in Moria down the well…*  
 No scene better illustrates what’s wrong with Jackson’s change in tone than this one. In the book, Pippin, fascinated with the well, drops a pebble down it. After a long fall, there’s a quiet *plunk*, followed long minutes later by the sound of far away drums. It’s an incredibly real moment. A young, impulsive character indulges what seems like a harmless but irresistible whim.

In Jackson’s Bigger, Dumber, Louder, Improved version, Pippin feels an arrow in a body, the head in armor falls off followed by the entire body, a huge iron chain, a ’55 Buick Roadmaster and anything else that could be comically, absurdly loud. At that point, OF COURSE there are drums because it’s a MOVIE MOMENT.

*2:21 Cave-Trolls and Spider-Orcs…*  
 Again, Frodo gets to cower. In the book, he stands side-by-side with Boromir, cries “For the Shire!” and stabs the troll’s foot with Sting, which wounds the troll. Here he runs, cowers, whimpers, makes one lame slash and is hammered by the troll in such a way that, even if the spear didn’t penetrate the Mithril, his innards would be jelly.

Next they run for the bridge and the orcs pour up from the floor and… out of the ceiling? Hundreds of orcs can suddenly defy gravity, crawling like spiders down the pillars, a super-power they have never had before in any version of the stories, and one they never display again. All for a stupid visual.

*2:26 Gandalf holds the bridge against the Balrog…*  
 This sequence makes me angry because it works **so well**, and the reason it works is because it is almost verbatim from the goddamned book! It is proof that, had J,B&amp;M just *trusted* the source material, they would have had a film with so much more depth, power and meaning.

*2:42 The Mirror of Galadriel…*  
 This was when I knew the problems were bigger than I imagined. The removal of Sam, and his vision of Bagshot Row being torn up, was the harbinger of Jackson having removed the Scouring of The Shire. They also fucked up Galadriel’s dialogue for no rational reason; “Things that are yet to come to pass” is a helluva lot less elegant than “Things that yet may be.”

*2:59 Aragorn forgets what movie he is in…*  
 When JB&amp;W threw out the plot point about an eventual choice of whether to go to Mordor, Minas Tirith, or split the Fellowship and take different paths, they apparently didn’t care that they also threw out Boromir’s reason for joining. Had Boromir been told (as he was in this film) that the Fellowship was *never* going to Minas Tirith, he would have ridden home like a good solider to advise Denethor. Instead, he tags along hoping to… what? Wheedle the Ring away from Frodo? Was Boromir instantly ensnared at the Council of the Stupid?

After his confrontation moments earlier in which Aragorn announces he would not bring the Ring within 100 miles of Minas Tirith, that should have been the last straw. Boromir either needs to take it and go, or simply go. But follow he does. When they stop at Parth Galen, *everyone* should have abandoned Aragorn when he forgets what world he’s in and says, “Orcs patrol the eastern shore. We must wait for cover of darkness.”

So… The chief of the Rangers, who has been fighting orcs for 60 years and understands that they are almost completely nocturnal; bred in darkness, hunting and fighting in darkness; and even though there are “new” orcs that move and fight in daylight, they are still *orcs*… this Ranger decides to *wait for the cover of nightfall?!?*

Of course, this is because the writers removed their reason for stopping. There is now no course to be chosen, but they still need Frodo to encounter Boromir alone in the woods. In this version, this valiant band of intrepid heroes simply fail to notice both Frodo and Boromir sneaking away. Apparently, Boromir is the only member of the party with eyes, ears and a brain. 

This moment makes everyone else an idiot. Frodo is an idiot for going off on his own. Sam is an idiot for losing track of Frodo. Aragorn and Legolas are *literally* on the lookout for threats but miss a full-size man in chain mail sneaking away. And Merry, Pippin and Gimli are just idiots most times, full stop.

*3:01 Boromir has Frodo in his grasp…*  
 The Ring makes you invisible, not intangible. Boromir has both hands gripping Frodo’s vest, and yet Frodo puts on the Ring and Boromir somehow… loses his grip? Uhmazing!

*3:03 Frodo gets permission to leave…*  
 This moment. **This fucker right here.** This, more than anything else, displays the actual contempt Jackson, Boyens &amp; Walsh have for Tolkien’s work and his characters. In the book, of course, Frodo realizes the Ring will twist the mind of *anyone* near it and so he must go alone. He makes this decision and goes off, saving only that Sam refuses to be left.

But Jackson’s Frodo is just baggage. He has no agency, gets to make no decisions. He merely bounces and runs from event to event. And Aragorn must be *Our Hero!* He cannot doubt, he cannot be uncertain. Frodo tells him he must go alone and Aragorn consents. He ***CONSENTS???*** 

Aragorn agrees to send Frodo off alone, followed by Gollum, with no map, no guide, and no idea of where he is going. Aragorn thinks this is a ***GOOD IDEA?!?*** 

Never, under any circumstances, would anyone who understood or cared about these characters write this scene. Aragorn’s flaw is his arrogance. He might send everyone else off to Minas Tirith, but he would *never* abandon the Hobbits, confident that her could resist the Ring. (And perhaps he could; he never seemed tempted on the long march to Rivendell, or at any point between there and the Argonath)

**Choose** to send them off **alone?** Go. Fuck. Yourself.

But Jackson’s Aragorn isn’t a person; he’s a Hero. An archetype. He cannot be so easily fooled or have choices taken away from him. He *must* be in command of the non-humans *at all times*. 

This choice by the writers breaks so much of what comes after it can never be fully recovered. The breaking of the Fellowship was supposed to be a chaotic moment of panic followed by an agonizing choice of what to do next. It is the moment when Aragorn truly becomes a leader because he is forced to make a hard choice. Prior to this, he has had Gandalf and Galadriel and the river Anduin to guide him. Under his leadership, everything goes wrong, and that is important. It makes deciphering Frodo’s tracks and choosing to pursue Merry and Pippin *matter*. 

That is too much complexity for Jackson’s Aragorn. No hard choices for him. “Yes, Frodo, you go. I have a huge, overblown action scene to insert myself in! After that, I know *exactly* what to do!”

This is when I actually felt hate for this film. It is unforgivable.

*3:05 Aragorn is INVINCIBLE!*  
 OMG this stupid, stupid fight scene. It’s bad enough that 60+ orcs in full armor (yes, I counted, and that’s just in that shot; seems closer to 100) were able to sneak up on Aragorn in the woods. Then he wades into them and hold his own. Sixty. Uruks. Who, apparently, only have bows when they face Boromir.

And the orcs come within a rat’s ass of catching Frodo; they see him, they chase him; but valiant Merry and Pippin distract the orcs and Frodo the baggage runs away again. Meanwhile, Merry and Pippin stand like the idiots they are while an orc, ordered to bring them in alive, comes at them with an axe and HEEEEERE’S BOROMIR!

Finally Lurtz the super-orc *remembers he has a bow (not that he knows how to draw it)!* And it fires arrows the size of fence posts! Because *of course* it does. All to add a ten-minute-long action sequence that isn’t even in the damned book. 

*3:15 Sam rejoins the movie…*  
 And now, here’s Sam, running back to the boats from wherever the hell he went for the last 12 minutes that he didn’t find a single member of the company or a single orc. In the book, of course, he actually reasons out what Frodo is doing (the only one who does), but that’s far too smart for this hapless version of Sam Gamgee.

All kidding aside, now Jackson has to manufacture a moment of emotion for Frodo leaving. He builds it out of yet one more push in on the Ring in Frodo’s hand followed by voice-over of Frodo and a flashback of Gandalf, and it’s a castle of pure cheese. This would have all happened organically if they had just shot the ending of the book.

This ending also makes Frodo a complete dick. In the book, he is sneaking away with the Ring on, and Sam finds a boat letting itself out into the river. He runs in after and Frodo hopes Sam will give up and go back. This version of the “making the dog leave for its own good” scene is just embarrassing, and because it’s an argument, it makes Frodo seem incredibly callous.

Then Sam drowns. For an hour. 

*3:18 And the rest is loud and stupid…*  
 It’s comedy after this. They send Boromir off in the boat without the weapons of his enemies. Aragorn loots the body, taking Boromir’s bracers for his own, ‘cuz that’s a thing you do to your friends and not out of character at all. Then, they all just watch Sam and Frodo go because this is Aragorn’s *decision*, remember.  

• • •

In the end, the problem is Peter Jackson, Philippa Boyens and Fran Walsh didn’t use the characters from the books. They used the uncomplicated, YA novel versions of them. Generic Old Wizard. Generic Fantasy Hero. Generic Dwarf. Generic Elf. And four Hobbits whom they seem to have forgotten were adults. It’s as if they treated the Hobbits like children because they are the size of children. One might think the men of Rohan wrote this script. 

If you’ve made it this far and think this is out of control, I’ll share that there were around 60 comments I didn’t make, or deleted. And that’s setting aside my issues with the technical filmmaking, which are many. 

Peter Jackson felt he could tell a *better* story than Tolkien. To my eye, all he did was tell a loud, simplistic, stupid version of a similar story.

Their argument was that Tolkien was not consistent with his spellings throughout the years and that the original spelling is not the same as it is today. Sort of a similar situation to how the Bible is a translation of a translation of a translation, so the meanings aren't always the same.

Multiple google searches of the origins of the name and differences between editions/printings brought up no results. They seemed confident in their argument (although they came off a bit tense) and I'm personally not knowledgeable enough to know about all the minute differences of each edition of the series. I felt bad not giving them the point since I went with what was on the card. The game even has a wiki for fans to submit corrections and that card wasn't listed as incorrect.

I've always been curious about Gandalf's (or any wizard's) abilities. Thinking back to the movies, every ""magic"" thing I can remember him doing seems to involve one of two things: 

* Talking to animals (Shadowfax, the Eagles, the butterfly that summons the Eagles)

* Creating light with his staff (holding off the Balrog, pushing back the Nazgul, scaring the orcs at Helm's Deep). He also pushed Sarumon out of Theoden's head, which may or may not have been using the staff in the same way, I'm not sure

His other feats, that I can remember, were all related to being really old/wise/respected, not magic.

He can't seem to communicate over a distance or teleport or anything like that, since he always rides a horse when he's in a rush. When fighting in Minas Tirith, he doesn't use any magic, he just fights (awesomely) with his staff as a melee weapon.

I remember Saruman threw a fireball once, but I don't think Gandalf ever did anything like that.

I'm just curious if the White Wizard's magical abilities mostly involve communicating with nature and having a staff that can emit ""good"" or ""holy"" light, or if there's more to it? Maybe he has other powers, but he holds them back in order to allow men/hobbits to reach their full potential, or something like that?",What are Gandalf's powers/abilities?

lotr,"After many hours spent reading and researching all of Tolkien's works, I have finally finished this project which I started over 2 years ago now. In a previous post I linked a spreadsheet containing all population and military size estimates for the 3rd Age. In a series of upcoming posts, I will be explaining my reasoning for each of the numbers starting with the Dwarves:




Blue Mountains: 10,500

 - My first thought when I started with the Blue Mountains Dwarves was that there was no real way of estimating the number of Dwarves that lived there. The only pieces of information that I had to work with were that many Dwarves moved out of the Blue Mountains to Erebor once it had been reclaimed, and that there were 3 of the 7 Dwarf Divisions inhabiting them (before the migration). I started by calculating the army that Dain would've possessed during the Battle of the 5 Armies. Dain brought 500-600 Dwarves to the battle, but likely left a large portion of his army back at home since it was a rushed call to action. He likely ended up only taking about 1/3 of his total military force. Assuming this, he would have 1,500 semi-professional soldiers at his command. Since Dwarves are a much more warlike than the other races of Middle Earth, it is safe to assume that this would make up around 1/8th - 1/9th of the total population of the Iron Hills at the time (this is also based on lower populations usually having larger percentages of their citizens in the fighting force). This would give the Iron Hills a population of 12,500 Longbeards. We can assume that this is roughly half of the Longbeard population, while the other half lived in the Blue Mountains. On top of this, there were the Firebeards and Broadbeams, though they no-doubt have smaller populations than the Longbeards since they had been nearly wiped out previously, as well as the Longbeards being the most predominant of the Dwarf races (likely about 1/5 - 1/4 the total Longbeard population for each race). This would mean that before the migration, the population of the Blue Mountains would've been roughly 18-20,000. With this in mind, we can assume around 1/2 of the total Blue Mountains population left for Erebor once it had been won back. This would leave the population with 10,000, and likely 10,500 by the War of the Ring (dwarves populate slowly, especially in the 3rd Age).

Erebor: 17,500

 - This one, with the above calculations already complete, is much easier to estimate. Assuming that 8-10,000 dwarves migrated from the Blue Mountains to Erebor, as well as a large portion of Dain's people from the Iron Hills (likely about 3/4ths of the 12,500 mentioned above), I estimate there were roughly 17,500 - 20,000 Dwarves residing in Erebor during the War of the Ring.

Iron Hills: 3,500

 - This was also very easy to estimate base on the above calculations. Since there were roughly 12,500 Dwarves living there during the Battle of the 5 Armies, and 3/4ths of them left for Dain's new kingdom in Erebor, we can make an estimation that there were 3,500 dwarves left behind to dwell in the Iron Hills during the War of the Ring (though they were likely called to Erebor to assist Dain in fighting the Easterlings).

Red Mountains: 31,500

 - Obviously, this number could be VERY inaccurate - in-fact, it's possible that there were no Dwarves living in the Red Mountains - but this is my best guess. It is largely accepted that the other 4 Dwarf divisions dwelled in the Red Mountains. Those being the Ironfists, Stiffbeards, Blacklocks, and Stonefoots. My estimation is that each of those races had less than half (for the purpose of the calculation, we'll assume 1/3rd) the population of the Longbeards (which, based on all my calculations above is around 20-25,000). 1/3*4 = 4/3,   4/3*22,500 = 30,000 Dwarves at the time of the Battle of the 5 Armies, and around 31,500 by the War of the Ring. Again, this is completely a guess since we have no real information about these Dwarves.

Other Dwarves: 2,500 - 15,000

 - There were likely other smaller groups of dwarves roaming/living in other mountains scattered across Middle Earth. I have no calculations to back this one up.





Let me know which of these numbers you would change and why. As these figures are not definitive, I am open to changing my numbers if it is for a valid reason.

lotr,"So, I'll start this off by admitting this probably doesn't have a simple answer, and since Tolkien did change his mind on things, from time to time, it might not even just have one, but...

Were the Orcs still Children of Eru? Did He abandon them?

They may, or may not, have once been Elves, twisted by the Dark Powers, but we are led to believe that they weren't made, as they were, by Eru Illuvatar; they were forged of something else by Melkor, who lacked the power to create on his own; only being able to twist what his father had already cast. It wasn't a simple process; fast or kind, and though I guess they could have simply resisted, till the end, and died, being swept back to Eru Illuvatar, at least some of those Morgoth took became Orcs, became loyal to him, and became evil. As they are, few others would show them love, or expect anything of the like from the orcs, in turn, but one might argue that, unlike the Numenorians, who were more simply corrupted of thought by Sauron, and punished for their transgression, the original would-become Orcs may have had no choice, being twisted beneath powers they had no hope of resisting.

And this will get me to Numenor, for a moment. I ALWAYS complain about the fate of Numenor; how an otherwise distant Illuvatar, who didn't step in, and intervene no matter the level of monstrosity was being loosed upon Arda, did his one Sodom and Gamorrah Old Testament moment, and obliterated the island of Numenor, and most of its inhabitants, after having Ar Pharazon, and his Great Armament swallowed up by the lands of Aman, for daring to sail into the Undying Lands. I always complain because it seemed an inflated sentence. He could have still lifted the Undying Lands, made the earth round, and left the Numenorian fleet sailing in circles, until starvation made them return home empty, but He didn't. Part of why this is, in my limited understanding, is that the Valar were forbidden to harm the Children or Eru; Manwe, Aule, Tulkas, and the others couldn't stop the Great Armament from reaching Valinor, and they had to instead beseech Illuvatar to intervene on their behalf, and so He did.

Well, what of the Orcs? Could the Valar harm them, in their many battles of the First Age? I won't bemoan that the Elves, the Dwarves, and the Men fought them; killed them. Had they not, the Orcs would have killed in turn, and they were rather monstrous, by this point, but it gets me back around to the question; were they still Eru's children, whatever their form, or simply fit for conflict, and destruction? Was there some truly twisted thing that Melkor, with his original level of power, as the greatest of the Valar, could do to them that changed them so much Eru would turn His gae away from them, and no longer see them as ""fit for purpose""? When they died, do we believe their souls still travel to Mandos, or were they so broken that they just poofed out of existence? Could they still live forever, if violence didn't find them, or were they rendered ""mortal"" by the machinations of Morgoth? Had He wanted to, and not used up His one intervention on Numenor, could Eru have ""saved"" the Orcs, or were they always intended as such, since none can act save in the will of Eru, and those who struggle to most will simply find they were given His most important parts to play?","Were the Orcs Still ""Children of Eru Illuvatar""?",1672527833

Salut!

Je suis a re-re-re (etc) lire le Seigneur des Anneaux, sur mon nouveau livre électronique et la version que j'ai eu de SdA est une nouvelle tranduction.  apparence que la traduction tient compte des derniers écrits et des notes pour les traducteurs que Tolkien lui-même aurait écrit.

le problème, c'est que je ne me retrouve plus dans les lieux!!! je ne suis plus capable de suivre sur les cartes le chemin de la fraternité ou me référencer lorsqu'on parle du monde!  exemple, fondcombe et de devenu Fendeval ou encore il parle de la rivière Argentine (aucune idée c'est quelle rivière/fleuve celle là)

je voulais chercher une carte qui aurait les nouveaux noms plutot que les anciens, ou encore un outil qui me permettrait soit de comparer à l'anglais, ou encore à l'ancienne traduction, mais je ne trouve rien!  la carte interactive ne tient compte que de la vieille traduction

bref, est-ce que vous avez connaissance d'un outil/site/carte qui pourrait m'aider à m'y retrouver dans les nom de lieux? les nom de personnages, ça va, c'est vraiment les lieux l'enjeu!

I’m doing my yearly X-max to NY’s rewatch of all all 6 extended editions, and I’m in the middle of An Unexpected Journey.

When Thorin looks at Gandalf and says, “where are you leading us?”

Gandalf just glares at him and says nothing.

All i can think is, “Dude, you involved yourself in something that Gandalf set it motion.  By hook or by crook, the greatest Maiar ever to exist accomplishes his goal, no matter what it takes, and won’t prevent you from exercising your Eru given free will for a single moment.  What did you think was going to happen?”


Also, random note:  In the wake of Morgoth’s fall, Sauron was captured by his Eönwë and commanded to return to Valanar for judgement, as Maiar are explicitly forbidding from passing judgement on other Maiar.

So, Gandalf the White, having been returned from death by Eru itself, passes judgment on Saruman, breaking his staff with a word, casting him from the order, and leaving him a mortal (with only the power of his voice left to him).

So, does that mean that Gandalf is no longer a Maiar?  Is he now a Valar?  Is he something in between?

If I had to describe him physically, and not just saying he was one of the kindest and gentlest people you could meet: he was tall (6 foot something, taller than my dad), had a big bushy beard as long as I knew him, a very deep voice and he was a lover of nature. I always loved going on walks through the woods with him when I was little (and we came across a bear one time!). Now, who does this sound like? 

For me, it's Treebeard. My grandpa's voice wasn't as deep as his obviously, but all the above attributes, and the fact that he also had a cadence in how he spoke like Treebeard, made me immediately think of him when he came onscreen. And upon this realization is when I started to cry. So much that my roommate heard me and checked on me thinking I was having a breakdown, and I was.

I'm a filmmaker and I'm starting to think people have a misunderstanding of how to make a successful movie or show, especially in the fantasy genre. 

Fantasy media is a genre that almost requires an expensive budget to make the unbelievable believable. Only animation can achieve a lower budget. That being said you need your movie to be watched by as many people as possible to make your money back. 

I also believe following word-for-word source material is a surefire way to have a box office flop but a great fan score. Not want you want when your budget is hundreds of millions. These movies/shows aren't made for super fans that know the lore, they are made for as many people as possible to enjoy.  

Not sure about this subreddit, but I know there's a huge push against this so-called woke agenda in the media. The introduction of black characters and powerful women seems to rub people the wrong way (among other lore problems). What people don't understand is that it works, that's why Hollywood is doing it. Because that is what the mass audience wants to see, they just don't want an agenda behind it, just let it be. Meaning, let a black character be black, we don't need a monologue about racism in a story where that doesn't exist. House of Dragons did this very well. 

Just curious, do you guys believe an adaptation should be followed word for word despite losing money, or liberties are inevitable so that as many people as possible can enjoy?","In defense of ""The Rings Of Power""",1672437614

Personally, I feel like he would have developed the Fellowship a bit more maybe giving them another adventure or two, padded up Frodo and Sam’s story in Two Towers befor they reach the Black Gate, expanded on the lore surrounding Sauron and explain more about Mordor’s workings, maybe add some information about Haran, drawn out the Scouring of the Shire, and give a longer ending to the already long ending.

I am not. I was talking to a friend, and he mentioned there were flaws, and I said “Yes, but not that many,” and he told me that the biggest one is that there are no women. He felt ashamed when he read an article told him there were no women, and he had loved the book so much, he had never realized that it never featured female characters. I’ve never been bothered by this. I’m a woman. I still grew up with a mind loving fantasies. I still enjoy Tolkien without him adding ladies to every story. Perhaps some would get bored with all the bearded dwarves and such, but I read it like it’s a historical account. It just flows of the page, and I’ll read any fantasy or historical fiction novel with that much ease in writing. I don’t know.

However, in like the second chapter Gandalf also remarks that the ring did not intend to be picked up by hobbits, and that it must be the work of some other force. 

Having read a decent portion of the first book, I’m coming to understand that the world of Middle earth is insanely complex and there is so much shit at play.

lotr,"Something I notice when people talk about lord of the rings films is how the movies skip the fact Gandalf was away for 17 years and by the time Frodo left the shire he was 50, while I get it’s not that big of a deal (and let be honest it wasn’t that important) but let’s consider a few things that could lead to the 17 year time skip

1. Frodo not aging, we already saw this with gollum and Bilbo as both of them got extended lives due to the ring and Bilbo looking around 75 despite being 111, it’s not hard to say the same happened with Frodo and even if it wasn’t life extending magic there’s 50 year olds who still don’t look old, sure there’s Sam, Merry and Pippin who are younger but apart from pippin they would have been in their 20s

2. Barad Dur still being under construction, we see in the film that after Frodo gets the ring, the tower is both still being constructed but also only as far as the hill top, and when they’re at Bree and the forests the tower is completed, but then again these could just be future visions like when Gandalf tried to pick the ring up

Overall it is confusing on whether or not a 17 year time skip did occur or not in the films but in my personal opinion it’s likely a skip did occur but not as long, but overall too I think that the 17 years was not that important to the plot, I get alot of the confusion also is due to Thranduin telling Legolas to find Aragon despite Aragon being like 10 years old but let’s be honest if you take the Hobbit films seriously that was your first mistake",Theory: the 17 year time skip still occurs in the film,1672252011

1.) at one point Adar says summon the legions. A legion should be… one legion is 4,000-6,000 men…and by him saying legions it should’ve been a massive army of orcs. Instead it’s a couple of hundred and they get owned by the lame ass human village.

2.) does numenor not have an army? They make it look like it’s a bunch of ordinary citizens going to protect the queen. Also, they’re all training in the town square like it’s a little show. And to make matters worse….they only use 3 ships? 

3. The Mordor PowerPoint, I mean…cmon lol 

4.) the whole halbrandt thing. Did he mean to be in the middle of the ocean? Or is it just luck? Regardless, stupid way of introducing Sauron.

lotr,"What I don‘t understand in Tolkiens work is the concept of evil and the responsibilities evil acts have on the person who executes it. 
Let me explain: IIRC when Morgoth longed for the silmaril he started to manilpulate the Noldor. His dark whispers created the concept of evil inside the hearts of the elves. Greed, hubris and selfish pride where emotions/ thoughts the elves didn‘t know before. Am I right? Morgoth brought evil to Arda and everything he touched got infested with it. 
I know his whispers fell on fertile ground with the Noldor, but only his interference caused the distrust for the Valar and the following desaster. So the kinslaying was a direct consequence of Morgoth‘ actions.

The kinslaying was cruel, yes, but was it right for the Valat to punish the Noldor that hard? Wouldn‘t it be wiser to forgive and show them right way? Especially when the Valar should be wise enough to know that the Elves wouldn‘t stand a chance against Morgoth on the long run? 
I find it odd for them to say „Nope. You don‘t fit our society of white heroes anymore. Go f urselves and see how you will handle YOUR consequences!“ when all of this was caused by one of their kind. I don‘t get it. It feels wrong. Especially if you look onto the suffering that the Noldor got back thousandfold afterwards. The children of Illuvatar did not know evil until Morgoth told them. The Valar were their to guide elves and men.

Maybe it's that nostalgia that makes me a little biased, but I feel like the soundtrack genuinely captured the essence of Middle-Earth, especially the Shire and One Ring themes.

When I found an audiobook that plays samples of the music score in the background, I felt greatly more immersed in Tolkien's world, especially the scenes in Baggend.

I find the Shire's music to be both relaxing and comforting, but at times it proposes a spirit of wonder at times. Perhaps even a bit adventurous. The inclusion of the violin makes old timey and rustic while the flute gives it the feeling of people who are closer to nature. It overall feels simple, but still promises fullness. If that makes sense.

Then I feel the One Ring's theme creates vibes of something old and until recently lost. It feels charming yet oddly sinister. Ask if the darkness behind it is more subtle than anything else.

One aspect of Gandalf's character that I find particularly interesting is his decision to spare Saruman at the end of The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Many readers may see this as a weakness in Gandalf's character, but I believe that it is a crucial part of his development.

Gandalf is not a vengeful or cruel character. Throughout the trilogy, he is shown to be a wise and compassionate leader, and his decision to spare Saruman reflects this. Gandalf understands that Saruman is no longer the powerful wizard he once was, and that he is now a broken and bitter old man. Instead of punishing him, Gandalf chooses to have mercy on him and allow him to live out the rest of his days in peace.

Furthermore, Gandalf's decision to spare Saruman also shows his commitment to the greater good. He recognizes that it is more important to focus on the defeat of Sauron and the restoration of peace in Middle-earth, rather than seeking revenge on a fallen enemy.

In conclusion, Gandalf's decision to spare Saruman is not a weakness, but rather a demonstration of his wisdom, compassion and his commitment to the greater good. By sparing Saruman, Gandalf is showing his wisdom in understanding that Saruman is no longer a threat, his compassion in not wanting to punish a broken man and his commitment to the greater good in focusing on the defeat of Sauron and the restoration of peace in Middle-earth.",Why Gandalf's decision to spare Saruman is a crucial part of his character development,1673406197

Titan was dead. The pieces of land were moving around the sky, there was no green to be seen nor any living thing that walked or flew in the air. The seas, rivers and lakes seemed like they boiled. 
Only because they did not listen to him. 

*We could have ended this. If you weren't all so stubborn, we could have ended this. All would live, children would finally taste bread and the sky would be clear. But you destroyed it. All of you!*

That was it. He tried to fight back then. No longer now. It is over.

""I am done."" he said, looking over the wasteland. ""Maybe death will be kinder.""

""I am not so certain. Death is too final, is it not?""

He jumped. 
""Who is that?""

""Patience, my friend."" Thanos froze. The voice tha spoke to him was ancient, wise...and melodic and beautiful. ""Rashness is what cost your kind life, did it not?""

The person who stood before him resembled a Terran. But only slightly. They were tall and majestic to look at. Long white hair and a the ageless face made them seem like a god of Terran myths. A specimen of physical perfection. But most impressive (and terrible) thing Thanos noticed were the eyes: eyes of flame and ash, yet holding wisdom beyond time and space itself. And why they? Thanos could not guess what this was: male or female. But it looked androgynous, as if, as if...

*As if body is just a garment they wear, not important to them.*

Thanos fell to his knees.

The Stranger smiled. ""Oh...we have had a bit of a problem, have we not?""

Tha voice tone sounded like that of a male. He, then.
""Who...who are you?"" was all he could ask. ""Are you...a god?""

Thanos never believed in them. Not until now.

The Stranger passed by him, touching him on his bald head. ""It could be put that way. I was here before all things. Before Asgardians, before your masters and before even the Cosmos itself."" he smiled again. ""*All* of Cosmos.""

Thanos narrowed his eyes. ""You...you knew this would happen?"" he straightened up and clenched his fist. ""You let this happen?""

""Pardon, Thanos. Do not be so angry, my friend. What could have I done?"" he shrugged. ""Nothing but observe. You were right: your plan of random elimination would have saved the planet, but they did not listen to you. If they did, they would be alive right now.""

He sat upon a rock. His fair appearance and...cleanness made everything around him seem pathetic, weak, filthy and ruined. As if a dead world already wasn't those things. Even the way he was keeping his right hand behind or in his robe made him look more...divine.

Thanos grunted when he realized what the Stranger said. *He knows my name.* ""No. They didn't listen to me.""

""And what you predicted came to pass."" The Stranger reached out with his hand and, in little sparks, a cup filled with a red liquid was formed. Thanos backed away again, glancing at it, expecting a poison.

""Do not be disturbed, Thanos."" he drank from one side of the cup. ""It is a drink from Earth, my friend. You would like it.""

Reluctantly, he took it and drank a bit of it. The taste was sweet, but odd. ""Are you from Earth?"" 

The Stranger waved in a dismissive gesture. He did it with such boredom, as if everything around him was ashes compared to him. ""That little world is like as an ant is to you. Sure, they are ants who can talk, so they sometimes get my attention because of that, but otherwise, no. It could not mean less to me.""

""Xandar?""

""Now, they are rats that might be useful at something, but still no.""

""Then who are you?"" Thanos asked.

""Ah."" he almost scoffed, but from his mouth it sounded elegant. ""A good question. I have always wondered how to explain when some of you ask me. In an as accurate way as possible, without your mind being unable to understand it.""

Thanos groaned. ""I don't like riddles!""

""Ah, good!"" the Stranger waved again. ""They cost me much a thing at one point. But, let us not talk about me, Thanos: how about you? What will you do now?""
Thanos eased his temper and looked around, seeing he chaos, ruin and death that was around him. He stood up, sighing. ""Die."" he said. ""I will stay and die here.""

""Oh, please."" he said. ""As I have told you: death is so...final. Why not use the time and resources you have for something else?""

""Resources?"" he looked back at his guest, with gnashes teeth. ""My home is gone.""

""You still have established property in other systems. You do not have nothing.""

""My home and people are gone!"" he mouthed, turning away. He had cousins all around the universe actually: Eternals. Thena was the closest one and he even had a brother, Eros. But his people who raised him and his home from childhood: they were gone. ""I have nothing else to live for.""

""Untrue."" the Stranger repeated and crossed his legs. ""For example, you could make sure nothing like this ever happens.""

Thanos turned. ""How?""

""Quite simply, actually."" he said and smiled. ""Just do it with your own hand: eliminate half of life in the universe and all peoples will live to see another day.""
He stared at him for a time. He said it as if he was talking about changing garments and then going to the toilet to release oneself. 

""You're insane."" he said honestly. ""There is no such power anywhere in the universe.""

""No!"" the Stranger stood up and smiled again. ""Incorrect! Again. It is possible: definitively so. In fact, as easy as drinking water. You just need a couple of things to fulfill the task and make it mean something.""

""Yes. I totally believe you."" he himself almost smiled, though he did not find it funny at all. ""Please, enlighten me: what is it?""

""The Infinity Stones."" 

Thanos froze at the mention that. The story as old as time: Infinity Stones, that came to be at the very beginning of the universe, representing its aspects. It was said even one stone would give an individual incredible power. Countless people looked for them, fewer obtained them: it is said in stories that even Celestials, the masters and constructors of Thanos' ancestors, looked for them and desired them. 

*There are six of them, he thought, Space, Time, Mind, Reality, Power and Soul.*

""Myths."" he sighed. ""Lies of ancient people. They never existed.""

""Really?"" the Stranger walked slowly and gracefully, not making even a small sound. ""Then why"" he reached out with his right hand. ""am I holding one in my hand?""

The Titan backed away. In the Stranger's hand was a small, beautiful stone, shinning with the light of yellow star. He felt it speak to him. Calling him. Thanos had no words. He just stared at it, then at the Stranger.

""You,"" the Stranger smiled. ""already understand that this might be the only way to do it: if you eliminate half of all life, the other half will thrive and live in prosperity. You thought of that yourself, did you not?""
They called him a madman, but he knew it was true: for life to survive at all, one half needs to die. And I was right, even just on my planet.

""It is a pity what happened to your world. It was beautiful. But there are other worlds out there, with children born, living and dying in hunger. Those worlds are just as beautiful as yours was. Would you want others to die too?""

He thought about it. Power to save everyone, by myself. He could not protect his own, but he could protect others. He looked at the stone, uncertain what he admired more: its beauty or the power it will bring. 

Then he remembered who held it.

""How?"" he pointed at him, accusing him. ""Who are you? Your name: now!""

The Stranger shrugged again. ""I told you: someone who wants to help you.""

""I might be desperate, but I am not a fool."" he hissed. ""What do you want?""

""You are insulting me, Thanos!"" he laid his hand upon his chest in protest. ""My desire is nothing more than for you to succeed. You see, our objectives are merged with one another.""

He tilted his head. ""Our objectives?""

""Yes. Yours, mine...and my master's, of course."" 
He blinked. This creature, standing in front of him, looking like a god in mortal world, had a master he served. ""Your master?""

""Indeed."" he smiled. ""Surprised? Oh, well, you see Thanos, the most impressive and gifted creatures recognize the greatness of those above them. My master, you see, is the Great Lord: Lord of Highest Places and the Master of Fates. A great power that belongs to **him** is rightfully **his** and the Great Throne is **his** dwelling place. I, on the other hand..."" he shrugged. ""You can think of me as **his** High Priest.""

""And what does your...lord want?"" Thanos asked with despise in his voice. He always hated religious fanatics. *This one is not a god, but surely presents himself as one.*

The Stranger looked at the moon closest to Titan. Even it was red as blood.
""We have enemies: my master and I. You might have heard of them and, if you have not, you will, under right, or, should I say, wrong circumstances. They call themselves the TVA."" his face twisted in disgust. ""A group of fools who think too highly of themselves and who stand as annoying insects at your neck.""

""What is their crime?""

""They are keeping some of my colleagues back. But more importantly, they are keeping my master at bay.""

Thanos chuckled. ""Who'd you call him: Lord of Highest Places? Right... If he is so powerful, how come he is held by that group?""

""A group can hold a great beast in chains. Does that mean they are greater than the beast?""

Thanos' smile disappeared. ""No.""

""Indeed. I would even say one only fears that which is greater than him. Nevertheless, in this they succeeded: others are out there and my master cannot take physical form in the Cosmos. Only I am able to step into reality and only I am able to touch it. So master chose me as *his* voice and *his* eye in the Cosmos.""

Thanos looked back at the Stone, his eyes basking in its glory.

""And this,"" the Stranger grinned. ""is how you will help me. Go and find them: the Infinity Stones. They are the very weapons keeping my master chained outside of the Cosmos or, as some of you would call it, the Multiverse. Do with them what you will: bring balance, bring peace, bring bread and breath to the entire universe and you will be its Saviour!"" he raised his finger to point out. ""There is one condition, only one thing you will need to do to return the favor to me: when you are done with your mission, you will destroy the Stones.""

Thanos' jaw dropped. ""What?""

""You heard me well: destroy them. All of them. Reduce them to dust and ash. That will be enough to accomplish my master's desires.""

The Stranger's gaze cut Thanos deeper and was pulling him more than any word that he has spoken, or anyone ever, for that matter. The fiery eyes burned: burned for real. They daunted him and made him feel like a rat. He only had strength to make one response.

""Will it work?"" he asked. ""Do they have the power to do it? Will I be able to do it?""

""Absolutely!"" the Stranger said, almost laughing.  ""Once you have the Stones, it will be quick and easy. All you will have to do is this!"" he snapped his fingers. ""And half of all life will end, just as you intended. The only condition I give you is to destroy them. That is all we ask of you.""

""I don't care for power."" Thanos said. ""I will not care for Stones after they served their purpose.""

""Perfect. Then it will not be hard of you to destroy them."" 

Thanos glared at the Stone again. He could feel its power, its strength, its energy touching his mind and sending thoughts as if they were words. He could save the entire universe. He would not be a madman like they called him. *They would call me a Saviour.*

He took it.

""There, you see!"" the Stranger clasped with his hands. ""Then it is all arranged! We shall both get what we wanted.""

""You still didn't give me your name.""

The Stranger raised his right hand. Only now Thanos noticed it was missing one, index finger.

""I have had a fair share of them, but..."" he smiled. Smiled like a devil.

lotr,"Not necessarily which film is the best in either its theatrical or extended form (we all know that’s Fellowship of the Ring heh) but which film do you think is most improved by the additions of the extended scenes?

As much as I love the extended edition of Fellowship of the Ring, the theatrical cut of that film is also a god tier, 10/10 film that’s pretty much perfect. The extended cut hues a bit closer to the book and has a looser structure and more measured pace that recalls the writing of Tolkien, but since the film is a masterpiece in either form I’m not sure it greatly improves the theatrical cut.

Similarly, I consider Return of the King to be the most hit and miss of the three films in both the theatrical and extended cut. I think the extended cut does ultimately improve the film, we get Saruman’s resolution (even if the scene isn’t great the character deserved closure), some really great scenes like the houses of healing, Aragorn mastering the palantir (basically the conclusion of his character’s arc) a great scene with Frodo and Sam at the crossroads of the fallen king, as well as some great scenes in Mordor fleshing out their journey. And while I know many debate Aragorn beheading the mouth of Sauron you can’t deny it makes his line “For Frodo” that much more impactful. The additional paths of the dead scenes are kind of dumb, but I won’t throw out the baby with the bathwater. 

But ya know, I think Two Towers is the film that most improves with the extended edition. If I had a big knock against the theatrical cut of that film it’s that Jackson spent so much time focusing on Aragorn, Rohan, and the Battle of Helm’s Deep, he ended up relegating the hobbits to supporting roles. The extended edition fills out both Merry and Pippin as well as Frodo and Sam’s subplots very nicely, while also fleshing out our boy Faramir is some ways that greatly improve his character and storyline.

lotr,"So I recently went through LotR for the first time and the novels were spectacular. 

While I expected the movies to not be able to include everything and skim over or completely omit some parts, I told myself that only the extended versions would do for my first watch of the series. 

I just finished The Fellowship of the Ring and saw that in the 3 hour and 48 minute runtime, strait up a HALF HOUR is credits. 

I thought “wow, I’ve always heard that even the regular versions are long at around three hours,” but I went to check the regular version and the credits there were only 8 minutes. 

Here I was expecting almost an hour more worth of content, and only get 20 minutes of extra content for watching the extended version???

We’re the extended versions a marketing scheme to get everyone to buy the series twice?

I feel gypped.

Is this common knowledge? Am I disappointed over nothing?

lotr,"-Sorry for bad translation- Fra to Eng.

I was 9 or 10 years old, it was in 2005 or 2006, I don't know exactly...

At that time, after school and during certain weekends, my friends and I used to go to a large park, near ruins, to play ""knights"", as they said.

No adults to watch us, no cell phones, no buildings, no roads, the immersion in our heroic marvelous universe was perfect.

There were about ten of us, boys and girls.  We had a lot of fun, I remember that the hours passed very quickly, too quickly.

In truth, we liked to mix all the universes that we liked at that time.

We had a lot of fun!  There were epic battles, knights equipped with wooden swords, magicians' staffs improvised with tree branches.

For the girls... Rather the princesses... The most miserable knights among us were transformed into magic horses, harnessed by jump ropes.

It was our universe, a mix of Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, our favorite cartoons and legends.

Me, I was a black magician, I was the bad guy.  My father, who is very handy, had made a magnificent magician's stick for me in a cherry branch during our holidays in Auvergne, enough to make all my friends jealous when I returned.

During a school trip, my older brother, meanwhile, had brought back a replica of the One Ring from Italy.

It wasn't mine but, although I wasn't allowed to use it, I really liked taking it on the sly to go and play in the park with my friends.

With this artifact in my possession, you can imagine that I was the most interesting.

Despite our young age, we liked to play in a very role-playing way, so I had become the most powerful, the strongest.

My friends were then particularly attracted by the precious.

And to avoid any effects of covetousness and envy by my comrades, I had crimped the One Ring at the end of my magician's staff.

So he was and would only be mine.

The battles were terrible, my magic was terrifying, growing, and the enemies bent under my power.

Until the day I stuck my stick in a cardboard shield.

In the heart of this park which was the scene of our confrontations, the ring had fallen.

It was only at the end of the battle, much too late, that I realized it...

Itt was then real tears that sprang from my body.

No more playing, it was no longer fun for anyone.

The cries of a child, who loses the object of the desire of all his comrades.

I had lost the Ring from Lord of the Rings!

Thus my friends helped me to search throughout the park, for hours, over several days, without ever finding the precious one.

That day, was it stolen from me?  I will never know.

A few years later, I returned to the park to remember the scenes of our heroic exploits, our merciless struggles, the countless losses, and the incessant marriages between knights and princesses, but also and above all to seek one last time the  'Ring.

I never found it, maybe it's still there?

Did someone, a child maybe, or worse an adult, find it before me?

They stole it from us.

He was mine. He is ours...

lotr,"I’m trying to make my own edits of the Hobbit and LOTR films, by ripping the films to my computer and using Adobe Premiere. I initially tried pirating copies, but they either have lower definition than I want or inconsistent subtitle formats for both Theatrical and Extended Editions. 

This has left me with the dvd choice of Blu-Ray or 4K to choose from, however, I don’t really know which one to choose, because I’ve heard there is good and bad aspects to both versions. I know that the Blu-Ray Extended version of Fellowship has the blue-green tint to it, that makes it wildly inconsistent with the Theatrical version, which would be a pain to dodge around in my editing process, but I also know that 4K has smoothed out a lot of the definition of certain shots, specifically LOTR. Though it seems to fix the tint issues for Fellowship, I’ve also noticed the 4K versions have made some other interesting color changes, such as making Smaug’s gold abrasively yellow. 

Ultimately I would like to hear everyone’s opinions on which version they prefer in order to help me make my decision. I did notice there was the Ultimate Collector’s Edition of the films, that had both Blu-Ray and 4K, which would solve my conundrum, but marked down, it’s still about $200.

Also, just a minor question, but do these dvds have the standard white subtitles? There have been versions of the films with small yellow subtitles that I don’t really like.","People of r/lotr, I call for aid",1673037638

What I noticed is that this plays in reverse. You clearly see the smoke going back into the house's chimneys while the scene passes. The banners blowing in the opposite direction the smoke moves. And if you start paying attention to it, the movement of those banners is very weird and not natural, because the scene plays backward. As is the movement of the lady's wardrope.

lotr,"When Gandalf calls Pippin a “fool of a took” many may have realized he just insulted Pippins entire family. But it goes deeper if you analyze the language a bit more. He is saying in less words the following ‘you are the biggest fool amongst an entire family of fools’. And yes in the books he did have that sentiment. But it goes deeper if you go back to the hobbit when Gandalf was looking for the 14th member he was looking for a hobbit that may have a bit of the old Took in him. The Took’s were known for being more adventurous (foolish in the eyes of other habits), kinder and more inquisitive. While the Baggins family was more stead fast, polite and learned. Bilbo was very well read mind you. Gandalf had a love hate real with the took household. He admired their willingness to go off on random adventures and the fact that Pippin was the most likely probably was a bit too much. Also if you take a closer look into Gandalfs action,  Pippin was the only one to receive harsh words from directly from Gandalf aimed directly at him. Yes he calls Denethor a madman but he says it to Pippin. Now if you believe this is because Gandalf hated Pippin and merely tolerated him. Or if you feel that Gandalf consoling Pipping numerous times in battle of Pelennor Fields shows that Gandalf was just frustrated his inquisitiveness and recklessness. Remember there is way more behind that “fool of a took” line.

Recently I rewatched all the extended editions of the Peter Jackson movies and I don’t know which one is my favorite now. Before rewatching them I would’ve said that fellowship was my favorite but now I’m not sure. Each film is so excellent and does things that the other 2 don’t do. Fellowship is so good at getting you sucked into the world and learning the characters and there’s a ton of emotion too. Two Towers continues the momentum and emotion that part 1 left off on in such a great way, and the journey with the characters is so good and satisfying to watch that it rivals the first film. Return of the King knocks it out of the park with concluding the story; showing where all the characters end up and how the story ends up in a very melancholy way.

lotr,"Tldr; Which order should I re-read all the books for the 2nd time. 1st time was Hobbit, LOTR, Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales.

Alright my fellow lotr friends. I am very close to barking upon my second ever re-read of Tolkein's works, and I am having a bit of a problem deciding which order to do things in.

First, allow me to say that as a young man, I loved the PJ film adaptation, and I am saving my rewatch of the trilogy for AFTER this re-read. I thoroughly enjoyed the movies and some PS2 or PS3 game I played back in the day, always wanted to read the books. As I grew older, I delved more deeply into the lore of various fantasy worlds (Star Wars, Star Trek, The Witcher, The Last of Us, Horizon Zero Dawn etc..) but I was always saving the best for last.

I knew that consuming Tolkein would be an adventure on it's own, but the more I delved into little YouTube videos about why the Hawks didn't fly The Fellowship to Mordor, or why Gimli was so devastated in Moria, I started remembering all the questions I've heard, with answers I didn't fully understand over the years.

-Why did Gandalf survive the fight with the Balrog?
-Why does the ring slip off fingers?
-Do Elves live forever?
-Who is Sauron?
-Who built all these ruins you see throughout the movies?


Whenever I heard the answer to these questions, it left me with MORE questions. What is a Maiar? What do you mean the Eagles aren't just Eagles? 

I am delighted to tell you that I have, slowly but surely, attained the answers to my life-long questions through both YouTube videos, and good old fashioned Tolkein at his finest.

I began my journey with The Hobbit, after learning about Tolkein's life experiences, I found it fascinating reading through this book with my new knowledge.

Continued with the Lord of The Ring. WOW! What an amazing set of books, I can't even begin - and won't bother to bore you - with describing the beauty of the world, and the talent which Tolkein so lovingly wrote this amazing piece of masterful literature. Finally gave me my proper introduction to the story how it SHOULD be told.

I bravely followed this up with The Silmarillion. I was always intimidated by this series of stories the most. However with a little bit of YouTube summaries to help hash out the finer details, I would like to think I had a pretty good understanding of what happens in the three ages, from an overall perspective. I may not be quite to the level where I can always name names and events or places correctly, but I understand the Creation myth, I understand the First and Second age events overall and the Third Age just kinda flew by. I found The Silmarillion to be very well written (notnthat it means anything coming from me) and although st times a tad taxing, I did find the varied and intertwined stories to be compelling.

Now I am nearly 2/3 of the way through The Unfinished Tales. Tying up the loose ends I have always wanted to know about. I loved the tale of Turin, I feel I am getting substantially better at reading Tolkein and understanding his flow at this point. I am cherishing the last bit of Tolkein's tales before I have finished.

Now, the re-read order I am considering is beginning with  The Silmarillion, The Hobbit, LOTR and any Unfinished Tales I want to hear again.

Should I go in this order? Or should I cut right to the juice and go straight back in to the whimsical nature of The Hobbit I've been missing these past 30 years of my life.

Also as a side question, what’s the general consensus of this game and its story? I’m not very big in the lotr fanbase and have only a bit of knowledge on the lore so I don’t know if this game is considered a black sheep or considered amazing by the fan base. Personally enjoyed the game a decent bit and thought the nemesis system as a whole was a cool concept. Plus commanding Uruks and the different beasts was really fun.

One thing I'm curious about, I don't recall from the books, and I haven't found an answer searching this forum, but this particular name I mention above.

I understand the implications of what ""Stormcrow"" represents and I believe Grima also makes the same implication in the movies.  Was Gandalf referred this way in Rohan and in Edoras in the years prior to him arriving in Edoras with the members of the Fellowship (absent Samwise and Frodo) or is this only a title thrust on him by Théoden while under the influence of Saruman?

When riding into Rohan, as Gimli says ""you'd find more cheer in a graveyard"" but I'm not sure if this is a product of the displeasure of seeing Gandalf come to town, a product of the current scenario in Rohan, or both?

Additionally, when counseling Théoden, at least in the film, the king gives a tepid glance at Gandalf as Gandalf counsels him.

But Anglachel has always stood out to me as having a very sword and sorcery feel. Much more than the rest of The Legendarium. This is from [a rather long essay I wrote](https://www.blackgate.com/2018/04/02/tolkiens-magic-sword-anglachel-2/) on Anglachel:

TURIN SPOILER AHEAD (Though you should know Turin's tale if you're reading this)

 'While magic swords are common in the modern fantasy/RPG world, they  were rare and prized in Middle Earth. Anglachel could cut through iron  and it glowed with a pale fire, which truly marked it as a wondrous  blade. It was also sentient, though that is not revealed until the end  of its tale. Horrified to discover that Niniel was really his sister,  Turin addressed the sword:

&gt;“Hail Gurthang! No lord or loyalty dost thou know, save  the hand that wieldeth thee. From no blood wilt thou shrink. Wilt thou  therefore take Túrin Turambar, wilt thou slay me swiftly?’ “

And from the blade rang a cold voice in answer:

&gt;“Yea, I will drink thy blood gladly, that so I may forget  the blood of Beleg my master, and the blood of Brandir slain unjustly. I  will slay thee swiftly.”

By mentioning Brandir’s unearned death and speaking of loyalty to  Beleg, Gurthang’s words indicate that it wasn’t animated by the essence  of Eol. The sword wants to allow Turin to right his wrongs by letting  him kill himself. This is quite different from the dark malevolence of  Elric’s Stormbringer, which delights in stealing the souls of the albino  prince’s friends. Stormbringer is revealed to be a demon, and it speaks  to Elric at the end of the epic saga, “I was a thousand times more evil  than thou!”

However, if we dismiss Eol’s dark character as the source of  Anglachel’s intelligence, there is no other indication of where the  sword drew its abilities from. We could infer it was a combination of  Eol’s craftsmanship and the meteorite iron, but that’s just pure  guesswork.'

lotr,"  Sigh. What is there to say about *The Two Towers* other than “What a fucking mess.” 

At least with *Fellowship*, you can pick apart the elements that Jackson, Boyens &amp; Walsh “improved” and explain why they feel so disrespectful to the books. There are also moments (a few) that genuinely *feel* like Tolkien.

This film is mostly just 8 hours of stupid crammed into a 4-hour bag. It’s impossible to truly analyze what’s wrong with this film because so little is right. In that regard, I’ll just stick with the broadest of strokes.

People in this forum often challenge me as to why I dislike the PJ films so much, so, by request, here’s a breakdown of what I find so offensive about the Extended Edition of *The Two Towers…*

*•* *•* *•*

*:03 Gandalf &amp; The Balrog fall for an hour…*  
 Okay, I promised not to nitpick but I kinda can’t resist. I know Gandalf said, “Long time I fell, and he fell with me,” but there’s a difference between “A long time” and “Holy shit, still falling.” Gandalf and the Balrog fall for 71 seconds. For the record, that’s a fall of over 15 miles. I *think* that’s probably excessive.

*:04 Sam &amp; Frodo…*  
 I will admit, now that PJ&amp;W are forced to treat them as main characters, Frodo and Sam are suddenly a lot closer to their book personalities. Without all the Important Characters to look after them, PJ has no choice but treat Sam &amp; Frodo like adults. Sam is capable, and Frodo is no longer a cringing coward, paralyzed by fear, and it’s refreshing. For this first bit, before JB&amp;W start “fixing” the plot, this actually feels like *Lord of the Rings*.

*:14* *Sméagol promises nothing…*  
 An incredibly important moment JB&amp;W either didn’t understand or didn’t care about. Sméagol has to **speak his promise to the Ring**. That’s how the magic, the control, the prophecy of it works. 

“Sméagol will swear never, never, to let Him have it. Never! Sméagol will save it,” and “I will serve the master of the Precious!”

Sméagol **must** say these things (or something close to them) to build for himself the clever trap that forces his own doom. The Ring compels the completion of both of these oaths. In the film all he says is “I will serve the master…” but that’s nothing.

*:18 Orc noses and Aragorn’s intuition…*  
 Not only can orcs climb down walls once per movie, they can also scent men an entire day’s run away (once per trilogy, because they never smell anyone who might surprise or overtake them again). And then Aragorn *instantly* knows the orcs have scented them! 

*:20 “And the union of the Two Towers…”*  
 STOP putting the fucking title into dialogue, Jackson, you hack! It is completely stupid and unnecessary. Of course this is followed by the most absurdly arch order to burn Fangorn that Christopher Lee could possibly contrive. *This thing will be your undoing; let’s say it out loud to make sure everyone knows you’re destroying all the trees!*

*:22 Burn this pointless village! We need an action scene!*  
 It really is so dumb. Yes, Saruman was able to raise the wild hillmen and the Dunlendings, but we didn’t need to waste the screen time watching this village being attacked.

It is also a really ham-fisted way to introduce characters to show Éomer finding Théodred (who was supposed to have been 41, BTW, not this pretty boy) just to take him home to die. We shouldn’t be meeting these characters until our leads meet these characters. It’s just crappy storytelling.

*:25 The Grima &amp; Théoden Show…*  
 There’s a part of me that really thinks Jackson was playing these characters as comic relief. Both Théoden and Wormtongue are presented in such ridiculous, over-the-top, comic-opera extremes he cannot possibly have wanted this to taken seriously. Here’s Théoden from the book:

“Upon it sat a man so bent with age that he seemed almost a dwarf; but his white hair was long and thick and fell in great braids from beneath a thin golden circlet set upon his brow. In the centre upon his forehead shone a single white diamond. His beard was laid like snow upon his knees; but his eyes still burned with a bright light, glinting as he gazed at the strangers.”

Compare that to the old man who cannot even open his eyes and speaks only to Wormtongue in unintelligible mumbles. Again, JB&amp;W have proven they have literally zero subtelty. Every element must be heightened to the point of utmost stupidity. The Rohirrim are a proud, warrior people. Is it plausible that they would still follow a doddering old man who could neither stand nor speak? Everything about this version of Théoden and Wormtongue is ludicrous.

Then, when Éomer steals Gandalf’s thunder about Grima’s price, Jackson ACTUALLY HAS WORMTONGUE LOOK AT ÉOWYN! Is this a student film? 

Next, guards come to beat the crap out of Éomer. Who are these guys? Are they being paid by Wormtongue? They certainly wouldn’t act like this simply on his say. Again, for this rotten kingdom ploy to work, Théoden has to be the puppet, not a slobbering pile of suet.

*:31 The Riders of Rohan attack in the dumbest possible way…*  
 Guess the orc’s noses don’t work at night because they failed to smell horsemen and horses. I recognize there wasn’t the screen time for the Riders to harry and surround the orc band as they do in the book, but having them display even rudimentary knowledge of tactics for attacking from horse would have been nice. Instead, they just blunder in. At night when the orcs have the advantage of visibility. And use bows at close range with their own guys running around. But, yeah, what did I expect?

*:40 Treebeard kills Grishnak…*  
 I *really* hate this introduction of Treebeard. Not because it isn’t what happens in the book, but because it’s completely out of character. It is an incredibly *hasty* act, and gives the wrong impression of how Ents behave (or how Ents *should* behave) right out of the gate. Immediately, he involves himself in the affairs of the other races.

Yes, Treebeard hates orcs, but in the book he suspects Merry and Pippin of being orcs and waits to decide. This version of Treebeard doesn’t even jibe with the one we see later at the Entmoot who is so passive he has to be tricked into attacking Saruman.

*:42 The Dead Marshes…*  
 The Marshes the way it was written in the book is so much more cinematic than what ended up onscreen, it’s bizarre that Jackson changed it. In the original, the initial entry takes place after dusk, and the lights (which are referenced in the film but never seen; maybe an effect never got finished?) are all around. The faces are much more dimly visible and hypnotic. Then the wraith flies over and the lights go out. It’s a *great* visual. 

Instead, JB&amp;M had to have their second zombie moment, and instead of being glamoured, Frodo falls in and is assaulted by shrieking undead faces and it’s all shtick we’ve seen a hundred times. PJ did it better in *The Frighteners*.

Immediately after this, Frodo lies there masturbating the Ring. Because even the draw of the Ring had to be loud and stupid. Instead of fighting until almost the end, we’re literal screen *hours* away from Mt. Doom and Frodo has already lost the battle. IT’S TOO FUCKING MUCH, PETE!

*1:05 The Elven cloaks are from Harry Potter…*  
 Of *course* Sam falls off a cliff near the Black Gate and of *course* two Easterlings come to investigate. Frodo wraps them in his Elven cloak and the observant Easterling stops three literal inches from the hem of the cloak and yet, in broad daylight, cannot see them. It is so over-the-top dumb I was expecting Frodo to have grown a lightning bolt-shaped scar when he finally opened the cloak (which has become a much larger molded stone covering).

*1:10 Merry &amp; Pippin are still idiots, and Old Man Willow is in the wrong film…*  
 Why do Merry &amp; Pippin have to have a scrambling pratfall argument about Merry drinking the Ent draught. Can’t Merry just… drink the fucking water…? Do we have to *witness* them growing, complete with gassy sound effects? 

And then here’s Old Man Willow, fresh from The Old Forest, just in time to make it seem like Treebeard isn’t even in charge of the trees *in his own Enthouse*, much less the rest of the forest. Because heaven forfend we go more than 4 minutes without a forced, unmotivated action sequence.

*1:19 The scuffle before Théoden’s throne…*  
 It’s been five minutes. Time for ACTION! Instead of allowing Gandalf to command the room, as he does in the book, the men of Théoden’s house rush in for a quick fistfight with Aragorn and the boys while Gandalf *actually casts the spell* to release Théoden. The subtle elegance of the book, *did Gandalf use magic or just psychology to get Théoden out of his chair?* We can’t have that. 

No, in Jackson’s world, Gandalf has to actually say “I release you from this spell!” But that’s not enough! No, he has to light the room with his white cloak, and apply electro-shock with his staff, jolting Théoden in his chair Once! Twice! Thrice! Complete with sound effects and a cutaway to Saruman flying across the room!

It is. So. Dumb.

In this world, Théoden is a barbarian king and wants to kill Wormtongue, depriving him of the delicious guile he displays in offering Wormtongue mercy by offering to let him ride into battle. Then, Jackson sets up Aragorn to immediately undermine Théoden’s renewed authority by stopping him from exercising his vengeance. The only person in this scene with motivations that make sense is Wormtongue.

*1:30 Helm’s Deep is a stupid idea…*  
 Nothing that happens in Jackson’s film after Gandalf Abracadabras Théoden makes sense. In the book, he counsels Rohan to make war against Saruman so the threat of Isengard will not be on the flanks of Gondor. They ride out, hoping to reach the Ford of Isen before the defense there has faltered, but they are too late. Word reaches them of the rout, and they fall back to Helm’s Deep at Gandalf’s urging.

In the movie, they spend a long time burying Théodred (whom the audience never knew, and there was no narrative gain to having alive at all), after which Théoden refuses to ride to war, and instead heads directly for Helm’s Deep (with *all* his people), which Gandalf thinks is a terrible idea. This is just pointless meddling with the story to add needless conflict between Gandalf &amp; co. and Théoden, and it makes the plot pointless. 

Apparently, in this movie, there are no keeps in Dunharrow? Why would Théoden then not simply head for Minas Tirith? Wormtongue makes a point of telling Saurman the road to Helm’s Deep is dangerous and slow. No one has any clear motivations at this point; it’s just a bunch of word salad designed to get to a huge battle, which is Jackson’s only goal for this film.

*1:35 Aragorn absolutely leads Éowyn on pointlessly…*  
 In the book, Aragorn is incredibly careful not to flirt with Éowyn. He recognizes that she wants him, and he gently, but firmly, shuts her down. It’s noble and honest. A bit cold-hearted, but he is part Elven (well, in the book; Viggo has a beard so Jackson’s Aragorn is plainly 100% human, but whatever). 

Here, Jackson has Aragorn flirting with absolute intent, just to say later, “oh, sorry dummy, my heart is taken.” It’s a shitty bro-move, and unworthy of the character.

*1:45 The Hobbits are idiots again…*  
 Sam &amp; Frodo’s brief time of being capable adults is all done, because now there are Important Humans about. While in the book, they realize Faramir’s men are near and hide, leaping out to make an impossible stand and thus impressing Faramir and his men, PJ has them bumbling into Faramir, falling on their asses and begging for mercy. No bold bravery here, just pathetic little people.

*1:55 PJ Sends in THE WARG RIDERS!*  
 What is there really to say about this stupid, pointless warg rider attack? Obviously, JB&amp;W felt they had gone too long without an Action Sequence! so we get this. It does nothing to forward the story, depletes Théoden’s forces to a comically small number, and inserts the so, so absurd “Aragorn is dead! He fell off a cliff!” beat. Everything about this is wrong.

The whole sequence ends with Wormtongue saying “But my lord, there is no such force!” only to be shown Saruman’s army arrayed below, so there must be some secret hidden entrance into Isengard because somehow Wormtongue didn’t pass or see these “tens of thousands” of orcs on the way in.

*2:10 Elrond prophesies Arwen’s ending…*  
 I actually really appreciate them including Arwen’s miserable end from the Appendices; a lot of people never read them, and fail to understand how few happy endings there are in Tolkien’s world. Most roads lead to sorrow. My only complaint is that it is so cheesily done, with Hugo Weaving chewing all the scenery and spitting it right into the camera. With even the slightest touch of subtelty, this moment woulda been beautiful.

Then, of course, it all goes to shit with Galadriel’s telepathic infodump (to Elrond, I guess?) for those who haven’t been following along. 

And, of course, Anborn knows Théoden has taken his people to Helm’s Deep even though there’s literally no way they could know this. Also, apparently, Osgiliath *just fell*; in his flashback, Denethor tells Faramir “but for you, this city would still be standing.” 

Weird because Osgiliath was ruined 500 years earlier, and looks it, and Faramir doesn’t seem quite that old. Gondor had retaken both banks about 20 years earlier, but then lost the east bank a year before the movie. Not sure what this memory is of them reclaiming Osgiliath. Just an opportunity for Denethor to be a dick.

*2:30 Faramir is just another thug…*  
 Tell me again how Peter Jackson does not have complete contempt for Tolkien’s characters? Faramir is *different* from Boromir. That is the entire point. That is why Denethor despises him. Faramir has studied with Gandalf, has a mind for history and strategy, and Faramir is not arrogant. But Jackson can’t abide subtlety or shades of grey, or the Faramir, who encounters the ring and turns it away, saying “Not if I found it on the highway would I take it.”

*This* Faramir lets his guards kick the shit out of Gollum. This Faramir is shifty and untrustworthy. This Faramir declares the Ring will go to his father, even *knowing* Denethor would become a tyrant if given it. Because in Peter Jackson’s universe, the Ring would already have won and Frodo been killed for it because *all* men are *instantly* susceptible.

Following this, Aragorn finally rejoins the movie already in progress, having taken a pointless little holiday in the river Isen.

*2:45 The Fucking Goddamned Elven Archers…*  
 No. No, Peter. You do not get to ignore *everything* about Tolkien’s lore and go unscathed. The elves Do. Not. Fight. This. Fight. For all the reasons you ignored, and everyone else already knows. The elves are leaving the fighting to men. Period. Fuck you and Fran and Philippa for deciding to include them. Absolutely no. The Last Alliance was the LAST. You DO NOT get to make a NEW one.

Worse, they are from “Elrond of Rivendell,” but they’re archers of Lorien, so it doesn’t make any logical sense either.

SO much is so dumb about this battle sequence. Relegating Gimli to comic relief status by putting him on the battlement, where he would never be in the first place. How easily the wall is overrun. The orcs being so much stronger than men as opposed to relying on strength in numbers. The orc running with the Olympic flame. The breach in the wall being replaced by a huge explosion (with Aragorn on top of it, naturally). Gimli jumping directly onto a field of upraised spears and missing all of them. The archers charging, instead of, y’know, shooting arrows. The Dwarf tossing. The ridiculous giant siege ladders going up fully loaded.

The goddamned shield. How did any of you ever forgive Legolas and the goddamned shield?

*2:58 The Ents decide not to go to war…*  
 I’m guessing primarily because they decided yes in the book. And, of course, because no one gets to be heroic but the heroes, so we have to set it up that Pippin *directly* leads the Ents to war.

*3:11 Faramir drags Frodo to Osgiliath…*  
 Just the cherry on top of making Faramir a myopic dickhole in this version. He sends the Hobbits off to Denethor, which means he *was* resisting the power of the Ring. He didn’t try to take it for himself. He is *choosing* to send it to someone he knows will do terrible things with it. But, yeah, JB&amp;W didn’t make any important changes to the characters at all…

*3:16 Gandalf returns with Éomer…*  
 So, the Elven archers (all of whom seem to have died by this point) were able to get here on foot from Lorien *before* Gandalf and the remainder of the Riddermark were able to arrive? Given that, in Jackson’s version, Gandalf brings these guys rather than the Huorns, this really seems like far too little, far too late. Especially since *none* of these horses would survive the charge down that hill.

Also, are both Éomer and Gandalf stupid enough to just charge into an entire wall of set pikes? Seriously, this is cavalry 101. Do Not Ride Into Pikes. Yeah, the sun comes up right behind the charge, but the pikes are still set. It’s SO DUMB.

*3:20 Frodo shows the Goddamned Ring to the Goddamned Nazgûl…*  
 If this isn’t proof that Jackson does not understand the story he is supposed to be telling, I don’t know what is. Right here, the movie is over (again). Frodo (now magically atop a tower) shows the Ring to one of the Nine. Sam saves Frodo, Frodo flips out and threatens Sam with Sting, Faramir shoots the fell beast with an arrow, and the Nazgûl **FLIES AWAY?!?**

None of that matters. Sauron now *KNOWS*, not suspects, not fears, but *KNOWS* the Ring is in Osgiliath, being carried by a Hobbit. The rest of the Nine would *instantly* descend on Osgiliath and tear it apart until the Hobbits were found. Even if that somehow failed to happen, it means ~~Gandalf’s~~  Aragorn’s feint at the Black Gates wouldn’t work. Sauron would know the Ring wasn’t with them. This moment completely and irretrievably breaks anything that comes after.

Then, in what I’m certain is a middle finger to people like me, Sam cries, “It’s all wrong! We shouldn’t even be here.”

What I didn’t expect was Jackson’s absolute disdain for the actual soul of the trilogy itself. When I watch these films, I see a lot of great work; the art department, costume department and makeup department obviously wanted to make *Lord of the Rings*, and, largely, they did a fantastic job. 

The script, however, displays obvious contempt for the characters and the world in which they live. At one point, in the Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens audio commentary for *Two Towers,* Boyens says, “Look, our version is just better!”

It's plain that was their attitude about the entire story, and it makes me sad. It makes me angry. Peter Jackson had all the tools at his disposal to do it right, and he pissed it away. No one in my lifetime will have this opportunity again.

I’m not interested in changing anyone’s mind, and you can save your “But dude, Legolas shield-surfing the stairs is AWESOME and I heard the book ends on a total downer!” comments as well. Downvote away. I’m not gonna stop saying the films are terrible, and I honestly don’t care about your arguments to the contrary. This just gives me an easy way to answer *why*. 

I have a lot of issues with the actual filmmaking choices Jackson made; photography, lighting, editing; but that isn’t what this is about. This is about *story*. Frankly, there are a million elements I could tear apart (i.e. *Dayum it’s bright as day in the caverns under the Misty Mountains… no wonder Bilbo found the Ring*), but I’m trying not to be too picky and focus solely on the things that really make me gnash my teeth. By request, here’s a breakdown of what I find so offensive about the Extended Edition of *Fellowship of the Ring…*

*•* *•* *•*

*:03 Elrond in the front lines…*  
 Why is Elrond literally the only warrior in the Last Alliance who couldn’t afford a helmet? This makes me crazy. It’s a little thing but it’s a good indicator of the kind of senseless cheats the next 12 hours are gonna be full of.

*:17 Gandalf prat-falls around Bag End…*  
 Right out of the gate, Jackson begins undermining Gandalf. These aren’t Tolkien’s characters, they are two-dimensional Fantasy Film Archetypes straight from Central Casting. Gandalf has to be a doddering old man because that’s what old men do; they walk into chandeliers and whack their heads on low door frames. Gandalf isn’t a demigod, he’s your absent-minded old uncle. That grinding sound is Tolkien spinning.

*:19 Bilbo hasn’t told Frodo his plan to leave…*  
 The choice for Bilbo to have not revealed his plan to Frodo is very odd. It makes Frodo seem gullible, and it also seems like Bilbo doesn’t trust Frodo, having not taken him into his confidence. It’s just extra story baggage that isn’t really true to the characters.

*:26 Gandalf is surprised by Bilbo’s party trick…*  
 Poor Gandalf. Even though he knows Bilbo better than probably anyone, even though he has plenty of time to see what Bilbo is doing, he is somehow caught unawares by Bilbo putting on the ring. In the book, of course, he adds a flash and bang to make it seem like a trick to mask Bilbo’s vanishing. But poor old movie Gandalf just isn’t that sharp so he sits there like a dunce.

*:27 “What about this ring of yours, is that staying too?”*  
 In the book, it is plain Gandalf approves of the party and the spectacle to make it easier for Bilbo to part with the Ring. That’s the entire plan. For some inexplicable reason, in Jackson’s universe, this is the first time the subject has come up?! So now, in the minute before Bilbo leaves, Gandalf has to browbeat him into parting with the Ring? Why? What narrative purpose does this *possibly* serve other than making Gandalf infinitely less wise than he is in the books? In this version, why wouldn’t Bilbo react as if Gandalf was trying to defraud him?

*:31* *Gandalf almost picks up the Ring…*  
 Had Jackson left the Ring on the floor to be encountered by Frodo when he walked in, it would actually have been a nice, relatively subtle indicator that Gandalf was afraid to touch it. Instead, we get this little waking nightmare with the flash on The Eye. At this point, in Jackson’s world, Gandalf should have no doubt, or, at the very least, much stronger suspicions that this is The One. At this point, it is cruel, criminal and negligent for Gandalf to allow Frodo to take it. But this is doddering Granddad Gandalf, so, of course he just backs away in fear and says “Keep it safe little dude.”

*:37 Gandalf is terrified and scares Frodo to death…*  
 I understand the drive to make the narrative more urgent by drastically condensing the length of time Gandalf is gone from The Shire, and the time Frodo has to plan, but having him return, losing his shit and literally jumping at shadows is just incredibly out of character. 

It also makes it completely irrational for Gandalf to then go off again. If he’s that afraid, he would never leave Frodo and the Ring. He even departs in the same direction as Sam and Frodo, and just abandons them in the forest instead of taking them with him to Rivendell and going from there to see Saruman. In condensing the timeline, Jackson, Boyens and Walsh have completely thrown out the logic.

*:48 Gandalf trusts Saruman…*  
 Oh simple, trusting, doddering Gandalf. In the book, Gandalf *never* trusts Saruman. He only goes to him at Saurman’s request, and even then, gives him no information. In the film, of course, Gandalf lays everything out like a simpleton. Then Saurman REVEALS TO GANDALF THAT HE HAS A PALANTÍR?!? Why would he ever do this? It is an instant admission of guilt and betrayal.

Then we have this stupid, *stupid* wizard battle. Ninety interminable seconds of Old Man WWF that ends with the most ridiculous spun-by-wires scene ever. This is the polar opposite of how magic works in Tolkien’s world. I am embarrassed for this film.

*:53 Frodo finally officially meets Merry &amp; Pippin…*  
 This is a huge thing that most people who love the films simply gloss over, but it changes the tone and tenor of everything that comes after. Before this, we have seen Merry &amp; Pippin precisely twice; once, being idiots stealing a firework to set it off themselves at the party, and again dancing on a table at The Ivy Bush.

Now we meet them stealing vegetables from Farmer Maggot, and Pippin says, “Merry! It’s Frodo Baggins!”

I don’t know why this change made sense to JB&amp;W, but in this version *Merry &amp; Pippin barely know Frodo*. They are, at best, casual, small-town acquaintances. They are absolutely *not* his best and oldest friends. Then, suddenly, they’re all just… together. But there is *absolutely no reason Merry &amp; Pippin would have gone with Frodo*. Yes, they’re mischievous young Hobbits interested in adventure, but this is actual pants-pissing danger. Absent the relationship that’s established in the book, nothing that follows between the four of them makes any sense at all. 

*:57 The Black Rider actually catches them in the forest…*  
 These Black Riders are so much more aggressive and unafraid of anything than they are in the books. One of them has already cut down the gate guard at the Brandywine Bridge in a quick shot. In the book, they are reticent to declare open war on The Shire and the Downlands. They avoid Maggot’s dogs; they attack the Prancing Pony by stealth. These Black Riders would just kill everyone and sift the bodies.

Setting that aside, at this moment, the movie is over. They are actually caught, in the open, by a Rider. Frodo manages to escape, at 3 ½ feet tall, running from a horse. The Rider doesn’t cut them down, doesn’t grab Frodo and pull him over his saddle. He just flails around. This moment is aggressively stupid.

*1:02 Frodo puts on the Ring at the Prancing Pony…*  
 As far as we know, this is the first time Frodo has ever put on the Ring, and instantly, he’s in nightmareland and Sauron INSTANTLY sees him. In the book, the real world fades a bit and hearing is sharpened; had this happened every time Bilbo put on the Ring, obviously, he wouldn’t have used it.

*1:03 Aragorn and Narsil…*  
 Now we’re getting to the point where JB&amp;W have fucked up the opening of the story so much that things are beginning to unravel, and will require a lot of pointless patchwork later on. Aragorn draws a sword here, but it isn’t Narsil. But why would it be? There’s no letter from Gandalf, and Butterbur barely knows him, so there’s no reference to the sword that was broken to give Aragorn his bonafides. 

Frodo simply… takes him at his word, which makes Frodo really dumb. In fact, in this version of the story, there’s no way Aragorn could have known to be looking out for the Hobbits in the first place. Gandalf abandoned them and rode hell-for-leather to Saruman, so who told Aragorn they were coming?

*1:04 The Riders assault on Bree…*  
 And in another Jackson “enhancement,” the Riders literally ride down an entire section of wall, crushing Old Harry underneath. Ahhh, subtlety. But after declaring themselves in this way, they don’t ransack the rest of the inn? They just… leave…?

*1:10 Saruman takes orders from Sauron…*  
 Here we see Saruman getting direct marching orders from Sauron. So we lose all the complexity of Saruman being a competing power and instead he’s simply a minion of Sauron. Makes everything that follows much more two-dimensional, and it’s unfair to Saruman whose arrogance assured him he was in control at all times. Clunky, clumsy, simple-minded.

*1:11 Aragorn hands out blades…*  
 Aragorn hands out four Hobbit-sized blades he just happened to be carrying. So not only did he magically know the Hobbits were coming, he magically knew *how many*, even though there’s no reason in the world Merry &amp; Pippin are still following.

*1:14 Aragorn fucks off and leaves the Hobbits to die…*  
 Everything that could be wrong with this scene is wrong. Aragorn goes to “have a look around,” and can’t be bothered to come back until everything is fucked. They are *supposed* to have a fire. Aragorn builds it in the dell at the top where it won’t be seen from below. The entire space in the film is much too small. 

The description in the books is artful; figures of dread and terror.

“Over the lip of the little dell, on the side away from the hill, they felt, rather than saw, a shadow rise, one shadow or more than one. They strained their eyes, and the shadows seemed to grow. Soon there could be no doubt: three or four tall black figures were standing there on the slope, looking down on them. So black were they that they seemed like black holes in the deep shade behind them. Frodo thought that he heard a faint hiss as of venomous breath and felt a thin piercing chill. Then the shapes slowly advanced.”

In the film four (then five) brightly-lit guys in black cloaks advance to so close to the cowering Hobbits it’s comical. Then, because every non-human in Jackson’s film must be Less Than Aragorn, Frodo just lies back terrified. He doesn’t call out the name of Elbereth (he doesn’t even know any lore, apparently), he doesn’t stab the Witch King, he doesn’t do anything but piss himself. Then, finally, Aragon appears in slow-motion with his generic sword and a torch (lit from what fire? Also, not a brand, and actual *torch*), *sets fire to two of them and actually fences with the others until they fucking flee because he’s just* ***that*** *badass*. Then the INCREDIBLY STUPID torch-throw that ignites the fifth Rider which then flees as well. 

This scene is just so *wrong*, so utterly and completely **not** from Tolkien’s books it would be comical if it wasn’t so painful.

*1:18 Shit-covered Lurtz and the Uruk-Hai*…  
 Yes, the Uruks had been bred to be bigger and less light-sensitive than regular orcs, but this is just absolutely ridiculous. They still only survive by strength in numbers, and trying to make a “super-orc” secondary villain is a cheeseball move.

*1:19 Arwen…*  
 Jesus, this… I get it. There aren’t a lot of women in LotR, and here’s Glorfindel just kinda hanging around not doing anything, so why not replace him? But this meet-cute moment with the sword in the forest, and Aragorn just chewing up the Athelas and mashing it into Frodo’s wound, it’s all so ham-handed. It’s like you told the story to an 8-year-old and then asked him to tell it back to you.

And, of course, because Frodo is just baggage in this movie, he cannot ride alone. He has to ride with Arwen so she can have this “Come and claim him!” moment. But we lose Frodo refusing the summons of the Riders, one of the most important moments of Frodo’s stoicism before reaching Rivendell. Instead, he’s just afraid and useless. 

Then Arwen calls the flood rather than Elrond releasing it, but she does it while they are *still in the water*. And doddering old Gandalf doesn’t even get credit for the horses in the foam.

*1:30 Elrond plots to manipulate Frodo…*  
 Elrond and Gandalf spy on Frodo and Sam, and it is obvious that Elrond expects Frodo to carry the Ring away from Rivendell. Frodo’s single most important moment of agency in the entire story is taken from him. Also, we see that Gandalf somehow recovered his staff from Saruman, but at this point, who cares about continuity?

*1:38 The Council of Idiots…*  
 Ohmigod this scene. What was originally a discussion of events and a council of war debated among the various representatives of the free peoples turns into Boromir almost taking the ring, Gandalf reciting the verse complete with Surround Sound &amp; Lighting Effects, Gimli trying to destroy it with his axe and everyone squabbling like children. 

JB&amp;W took something reasoned and intelligent and made it loud and stupid. I want to punch this scene in the teeth. I’m glad they removed Bilbo, he deserves better. Then they end it by fucking up Frodo’s most important moment so that he has to shout “I will take the Ring!” three times. No, quiet dignity and strength is only for Aragorn, silly Hobbit!

Followed by the awful “My sword! My bow! My axe” scene, because, in this version, they’re just volunteering rather than being chosen. And Merry &amp; Pippin, now **REALLY HERE FOR NO REASON**, declare they will have to be bound in a sack to keep them from going.

Then… oh god, then… they actually wrote down the fucking title and *made Hugo Weaving say it.* “You will be the Fellowship of the Ring!”

*1:52 Gimli suggest going through Moria…*  
 Of all the changes made by JB&amp;W this one confuses me the most. Moria was a huge Dwarven city, Balin decided to retake Moria over thirty years before the Fellowship set out, and he has been presumed dead for decades. There has been no word from Moria, but Gimli seems to think it’s viable and operating. “My cousin Balin would give us a royal welcome.”

Gimli being ignorant of Moria’s status while both Gandalf and Aragorn fear that it is a death trap is a really bizarre story choice. It makes no sense logically, and it doesn’t make any sense structurally. I can’t figure out why they thought this was “better” in any way. Even Saruman (Sauron’s proxy as a villain all through this trilogy) seems to know there’s a Balrog waiting in Moria.

*1:55 Saruman can do anything…*  
 Saruman seems to have no limits in this film. He uses the crows as spies. He controls the weather. He causes a landslide in the pass of Caradhras. He calls lightning from hundreds of leagues away… it’s just too much. This isn’t how magic works in Tolkien’s world, but we’re not in Middle-Earth, we’re in a mediocre D&amp;D adventure where the bad guy knows *everything*. Then Gandalf defers to Frodo, who has no idea what the options are or what they mean. 

*2:02 Gandalf can’t open the doors…*  
 Doddering old Gandalf can’t even come up with the answer. Frodo, the sudden riddle-master (it isn’t a riddle at all, but whatever) has to figure this out? Why did they even bring Gandalf? Once they get in to what is obviously an unlit, disused, long-abandoned entrance, Gimli, who is plainly delusional, says, “Soon, Mr. Elf, you will enjoy the fabled hospitality of the Dwarves. Roaring fires! Malt beer! Red meat off the bone!” It makes NO SENSE.

Imagine having to go through the remains of Fukushima to get somewhere. You know there was an accident, and people went in thirty years ago to do cleanup but there has been zero communication. Why, upon reaching the desolate, abandoned outskirts, would you announce how great it will be?

*2:13 Pippin knocks every piece of metal in Moria down the well…*  
 No scene better illustrates what’s wrong with Jackson’s change in tone than this one. In the book, Pippin, fascinated with the well, drops a pebble down it. After a long fall, there’s a quiet *plunk*, followed long minutes later by the sound of far away drums. It’s an incredibly real moment. A young, impulsive character indulges what seems like a harmless but irresistible whim.

In Jackson’s Bigger, Dumber, Louder, Improved version, Pippin feels an arrow in a body, the head in armor falls off followed by the entire body, a huge iron chain, a ’55 Buick Roadmaster and anything else that could be comically, absurdly loud. At that point, OF COURSE there are drums because it’s a MOVIE MOMENT.

*2:21 Cave-Trolls and Spider-Orcs…*  
 Again, Frodo gets to cower. In the book, he stands side-by-side with Boromir, cries “For the Shire!” and stabs the troll’s foot with Sting, which wounds the troll. Here he runs, cowers, whimpers, makes one lame slash and is hammered by the troll in such a way that, even if the spear didn’t penetrate the Mithril, his innards would be jelly.

Next they run for the bridge and the orcs pour up from the floor and… out of the ceiling? Hundreds of orcs can suddenly defy gravity, crawling like spiders down the pillars, a super-power they have never had before in any version of the stories, and one they never display again. All for a stupid visual.

*2:26 Gandalf holds the bridge against the Balrog…*  
 This sequence makes me angry because it works **so well**, and the reason it works is because it is almost verbatim from the goddamned book! It is proof that, had J,B&amp;M just *trusted* the source material, they would have had a film with so much more depth, power and meaning.

*2:42 The Mirror of Galadriel…*  
 This was when I knew the problems were bigger than I imagined. The removal of Sam, and his vision of Bagshot Row being torn up, was the harbinger of Jackson having removed the Scouring of The Shire. They also fucked up Galadriel’s dialogue for no rational reason; “Things that are yet to come to pass” is a helluva lot less elegant than “Things that yet may be.”

*2:59 Aragorn forgets what movie he is in…*  
 When JB&amp;W threw out the plot point about an eventual choice of whether to go to Mordor, Minas Tirith, or split the Fellowship and take different paths, they apparently didn’t care that they also threw out Boromir’s reason for joining. Had Boromir been told (as he was in this film) that the Fellowship was *never* going to Minas Tirith, he would have ridden home like a good solider to advise Denethor. Instead, he tags along hoping to… what? Wheedle the Ring away from Frodo? Was Boromir instantly ensnared at the Council of the Stupid?

After his confrontation moments earlier in which Aragorn announces he would not bring the Ring within 100 miles of Minas Tirith, that should have been the last straw. Boromir either needs to take it and go, or simply go. But follow he does. When they stop at Parth Galen, *everyone* should have abandoned Aragorn when he forgets what world he’s in and says, “Orcs patrol the eastern shore. We must wait for cover of darkness.”

So… The chief of the Rangers, who has been fighting orcs for 60 years and understands that they are almost completely nocturnal; bred in darkness, hunting and fighting in darkness; and even though there are “new” orcs that move and fight in daylight, they are still *orcs*… this Ranger decides to *wait for the cover of nightfall?!?*

Of course, this is because the writers removed their reason for stopping. There is now no course to be chosen, but they still need Frodo to encounter Boromir alone in the woods. In this version, this valiant band of intrepid heroes simply fail to notice both Frodo and Boromir sneaking away. Apparently, Boromir is the only member of the party with eyes, ears and a brain. 

This moment makes everyone else an idiot. Frodo is an idiot for going off on his own. Sam is an idiot for losing track of Frodo. Aragorn and Legolas are *literally* on the lookout for threats but miss a full-size man in chain mail sneaking away. And Merry, Pippin and Gimli are just idiots most times, full stop.

*3:01 Boromir has Frodo in his grasp…*  
 The Ring makes you invisible, not intangible. Boromir has both hands gripping Frodo’s vest, and yet Frodo puts on the Ring and Boromir somehow… loses his grip? Uhmazing!

*3:03 Frodo gets permission to leave…*  
 This moment. **This fucker right here.** This, more than anything else, displays the actual contempt Jackson, Boyens &amp; Walsh have for Tolkien’s work and his characters. In the book, of course, Frodo realizes the Ring will twist the mind of *anyone* near it and so he must go alone. He makes this decision and goes off, saving only that Sam refuses to be left.

But Jackson’s Frodo is just baggage. He has no agency, gets to make no decisions. He merely bounces and runs from event to event. And Aragorn must be *Our Hero!* He cannot doubt, he cannot be uncertain. Frodo tells him he must go alone and Aragorn consents. He ***CONSENTS???*** 

Aragorn agrees to send Frodo off alone, followed by Gollum, with no map, no guide, and no idea of where he is going. Aragorn thinks this is a ***GOOD IDEA?!?*** 

Never, under any circumstances, would anyone who understood or cared about these characters write this scene. Aragorn’s flaw is his arrogance. He might send everyone else off to Minas Tirith, but he would *never* abandon the Hobbits, confident that her could resist the Ring. (And perhaps he could; he never seemed tempted on the long march to Rivendell, or at any point between there and the Argonath)

**Choose** to send them off **alone?** Go. Fuck. Yourself.

But Jackson’s Aragorn isn’t a person; he’s a Hero. An archetype. He cannot be so easily fooled or have choices taken away from him. He *must* be in command of the non-humans *at all times*. 

This choice by the writers breaks so much of what comes after it can never be fully recovered. The breaking of the Fellowship was supposed to be a chaotic moment of panic followed by an agonizing choice of what to do next. It is the moment when Aragorn truly becomes a leader because he is forced to make a hard choice. Prior to this, he has had Gandalf and Galadriel and the river Anduin to guide him. Under his leadership, everything goes wrong, and that is important. It makes deciphering Frodo’s tracks and choosing to pursue Merry and Pippin *matter*. 

That is too much complexity for Jackson’s Aragorn. No hard choices for him. “Yes, Frodo, you go. I have a huge, overblown action scene to insert myself in! After that, I know *exactly* what to do!”

This is when I actually felt hate for this film. It is unforgivable.

*3:05 Aragorn is INVINCIBLE!*  
 OMG this stupid, stupid fight scene. It’s bad enough that 60+ orcs in full armor (yes, I counted, and that’s just in that shot; seems closer to 100) were able to sneak up on Aragorn in the woods. Then he wades into them and hold his own. Sixty. Uruks. Who, apparently, only have bows when they face Boromir.

And the orcs come within a rat’s ass of catching Frodo; they see him, they chase him; but valiant Merry and Pippin distract the orcs and Frodo the baggage runs away again. Meanwhile, Merry and Pippin stand like the idiots they are while an orc, ordered to bring them in alive, comes at them with an axe and HEEEEERE’S BOROMIR!

Finally Lurtz the super-orc *remembers he has a bow (not that he knows how to draw it)!* And it fires arrows the size of fence posts! Because *of course* it does. All to add a ten-minute-long action sequence that isn’t even in the damned book. 

*3:15 Sam rejoins the movie…*  
 And now, here’s Sam, running back to the boats from wherever the hell he went for the last 12 minutes that he didn’t find a single member of the company or a single orc. In the book, of course, he actually reasons out what Frodo is doing (the only one who does), but that’s far too smart for this hapless version of Sam Gamgee.

All kidding aside, now Jackson has to manufacture a moment of emotion for Frodo leaving. He builds it out of yet one more push in on the Ring in Frodo’s hand followed by voice-over of Frodo and a flashback of Gandalf, and it’s a castle of pure cheese. This would have all happened organically if they had just shot the ending of the book.

This ending also makes Frodo a complete dick. In the book, he is sneaking away with the Ring on, and Sam finds a boat letting itself out into the river. He runs in after and Frodo hopes Sam will give up and go back. This version of the “making the dog leave for its own good” scene is just embarrassing, and because it’s an argument, it makes Frodo seem incredibly callous.

Then Sam drowns. For an hour. 

*3:18 And the rest is loud and stupid…*  
 It’s comedy after this. They send Boromir off in the boat without the weapons of his enemies. Aragorn loots the body, taking Boromir’s bracers for his own, ‘cuz that’s a thing you do to your friends and not out of character at all. Then, they all just watch Sam and Frodo go because this is Aragorn’s *decision*, remember.  

• • •

In the end, the problem is Peter Jackson, Philippa Boyens and Fran Walsh didn’t use the characters from the books. They used the uncomplicated, YA novel versions of them. Generic Old Wizard. Generic Fantasy Hero. Generic Dwarf. Generic Elf. And four Hobbits whom they seem to have forgotten were adults. It’s as if they treated the Hobbits like children because they are the size of children. One might think the men of Rohan wrote this script. 

If you’ve made it this far and think this is out of control, I’ll share that there were around 60 comments I didn’t make, or deleted. And that’s setting aside my issues with the technical filmmaking, which are many. 

Peter Jackson felt he could tell a *better* story than Tolkien. To my eye, all he did was tell a loud, simplistic, stupid version of a similar story.

Their argument was that Tolkien was not consistent with his spellings throughout the years and that the original spelling is not the same as it is today. Sort of a similar situation to how the Bible is a translation of a translation of a translation, so the meanings aren't always the same.

Multiple google searches of the origins of the name and differences between editions/printings brought up no results. They seemed confident in their argument (although they came off a bit tense) and I'm personally not knowledgeable enough to know about all the minute differences of each edition of the series. I felt bad not giving them the point since I went with what was on the card. The game even has a wiki for fans to submit corrections and that card wasn't listed as incorrect.

I've always been curious about Gandalf's (or any wizard's) abilities. Thinking back to the movies, every ""magic"" thing I can remember him doing seems to involve one of two things: 

* Talking to animals (Shadowfax, the Eagles, the butterfly that summons the Eagles)

* Creating light with his staff (holding off the Balrog, pushing back the Nazgul, scaring the orcs at Helm's Deep). He also pushed Sarumon out of Theoden's head, which may or may not have been using the staff in the same way, I'm not sure

His other feats, that I can remember, were all related to being really old/wise/respected, not magic.

He can't seem to communicate over a distance or teleport or anything like that, since he always rides a horse when he's in a rush. When fighting in Minas Tirith, he doesn't use any magic, he just fights (awesomely) with his staff as a melee weapon.

I remember Saruman threw a fireball once, but I don't think Gandalf ever did anything like that.

I'm just curious if the White Wizard's magical abilities mostly involve communicating with nature and having a staff that can emit ""good"" or ""holy"" light, or if there's more to it? Maybe he has other powers, but he holds them back in order to allow men/hobbits to reach their full potential, or something like that?",What are Gandalf's powers/abilities?

lotr,"After many hours spent reading and researching all of Tolkien's works, I have finally finished this project which I started over 2 years ago now. In a previous post I linked a spreadsheet containing all population and military size estimates for the 3rd Age. In a series of upcoming posts, I will be explaining my reasoning for each of the numbers starting with the Dwarves:




Blue Mountains: 10,500

 - My first thought when I started with the Blue Mountains Dwarves was that there was no real way of estimating the number of Dwarves that lived there. The only pieces of information that I had to work with were that many Dwarves moved out of the Blue Mountains to Erebor once it had been reclaimed, and that there were 3 of the 7 Dwarf Divisions inhabiting them (before the migration). I started by calculating the army that Dain would've possessed during the Battle of the 5 Armies. Dain brought 500-600 Dwarves to the battle, but likely left a large portion of his army back at home since it was a rushed call to action. He likely ended up only taking about 1/3 of his total military force. Assuming this, he would have 1,500 semi-professional soldiers at his command. Since Dwarves are a much more warlike than the other races of Middle Earth, it is safe to assume that this would make up around 1/8th - 1/9th of the total population of the Iron Hills at the time (this is also based on lower populations usually having larger percentages of their citizens in the fighting force). This would give the Iron Hills a population of 12,500 Longbeards. We can assume that this is roughly half of the Longbeard population, while the other half lived in the Blue Mountains. On top of this, there were the Firebeards and Broadbeams, though they no-doubt have smaller populations than the Longbeards since they had been nearly wiped out previously, as well as the Longbeards being the most predominant of the Dwarf races (likely about 1/5 - 1/4 the total Longbeard population for each race). This would mean that before the migration, the population of the Blue Mountains would've been roughly 18-20,000. With this in mind, we can assume around 1/2 of the total Blue Mountains population left for Erebor once it had been won back. This would leave the population with 10,000, and likely 10,500 by the War of the Ring (dwarves populate slowly, especially in the 3rd Age).

Erebor: 17,500

 - This one, with the above calculations already complete, is much easier to estimate. Assuming that 8-10,000 dwarves migrated from the Blue Mountains to Erebor, as well as a large portion of Dain's people from the Iron Hills (likely about 3/4ths of the 12,500 mentioned above), I estimate there were roughly 17,500 - 20,000 Dwarves residing in Erebor during the War of the Ring.

Iron Hills: 3,500

 - This was also very easy to estimate base on the above calculations. Since there were roughly 12,500 Dwarves living there during the Battle of the 5 Armies, and 3/4ths of them left for Dain's new kingdom in Erebor, we can make an estimation that there were 3,500 dwarves left behind to dwell in the Iron Hills during the War of the Ring (though they were likely called to Erebor to assist Dain in fighting the Easterlings).

Red Mountains: 31,500

 - Obviously, this number could be VERY inaccurate - in-fact, it's possible that there were no Dwarves living in the Red Mountains - but this is my best guess. It is largely accepted that the other 4 Dwarf divisions dwelled in the Red Mountains. Those being the Ironfists, Stiffbeards, Blacklocks, and Stonefoots. My estimation is that each of those races had less than half (for the purpose of the calculation, we'll assume 1/3rd) the population of the Longbeards (which, based on all my calculations above is around 20-25,000). 1/3*4 = 4/3,   4/3*22,500 = 30,000 Dwarves at the time of the Battle of the 5 Armies, and around 31,500 by the War of the Ring. Again, this is completely a guess since we have no real information about these Dwarves.

Other Dwarves: 2,500 - 15,000

 - There were likely other smaller groups of dwarves roaming/living in other mountains scattered across Middle Earth. I have no calculations to back this one up.





Let me know which of these numbers you would change and why. As these figures are not definitive, I am open to changing my numbers if it is for a valid reason.

lotr,"So, I'll start this off by admitting this probably doesn't have a simple answer, and since Tolkien did change his mind on things, from time to time, it might not even just have one, but...

Were the Orcs still Children of Eru? Did He abandon them?

They may, or may not, have once been Elves, twisted by the Dark Powers, but we are led to believe that they weren't made, as they were, by Eru Illuvatar; they were forged of something else by Melkor, who lacked the power to create on his own; only being able to twist what his father had already cast. It wasn't a simple process; fast or kind, and though I guess they could have simply resisted, till the end, and died, being swept back to Eru Illuvatar, at least some of those Morgoth took became Orcs, became loyal to him, and became evil. As they are, few others would show them love, or expect anything of the like from the orcs, in turn, but one might argue that, unlike the Numenorians, who were more simply corrupted of thought by Sauron, and punished for their transgression, the original would-become Orcs may have had no choice, being twisted beneath powers they had no hope of resisting.

And this will get me to Numenor, for a moment. I ALWAYS complain about the fate of Numenor; how an otherwise distant Illuvatar, who didn't step in, and intervene no matter the level of monstrosity was being loosed upon Arda, did his one Sodom and Gamorrah Old Testament moment, and obliterated the island of Numenor, and most of its inhabitants, after having Ar Pharazon, and his Great Armament swallowed up by the lands of Aman, for daring to sail into the Undying Lands. I always complain because it seemed an inflated sentence. He could have still lifted the Undying Lands, made the earth round, and left the Numenorian fleet sailing in circles, until starvation made them return home empty, but He didn't. Part of why this is, in my limited understanding, is that the Valar were forbidden to harm the Children or Eru; Manwe, Aule, Tulkas, and the others couldn't stop the Great Armament from reaching Valinor, and they had to instead beseech Illuvatar to intervene on their behalf, and so He did.

Well, what of the Orcs? Could the Valar harm them, in their many battles of the First Age? I won't bemoan that the Elves, the Dwarves, and the Men fought them; killed them. Had they not, the Orcs would have killed in turn, and they were rather monstrous, by this point, but it gets me back around to the question; were they still Eru's children, whatever their form, or simply fit for conflict, and destruction? Was there some truly twisted thing that Melkor, with his original level of power, as the greatest of the Valar, could do to them that changed them so much Eru would turn His gae away from them, and no longer see them as ""fit for purpose""? When they died, do we believe their souls still travel to Mandos, or were they so broken that they just poofed out of existence? Could they still live forever, if violence didn't find them, or were they rendered ""mortal"" by the machinations of Morgoth? Had He wanted to, and not used up His one intervention on Numenor, could Eru have ""saved"" the Orcs, or were they always intended as such, since none can act save in the will of Eru, and those who struggle to most will simply find they were given His most important parts to play?","Were the Orcs Still ""Children of Eru Illuvatar""?",1672527833

Salut!

Je suis a re-re-re (etc) lire le Seigneur des Anneaux, sur mon nouveau livre électronique et la version que j'ai eu de SdA est une nouvelle tranduction.  apparence que la traduction tient compte des derniers écrits et des notes pour les traducteurs que Tolkien lui-même aurait écrit.

le problème, c'est que je ne me retrouve plus dans les lieux!!! je ne suis plus capable de suivre sur les cartes le chemin de la fraternité ou me référencer lorsqu'on parle du monde!  exemple, fondcombe et de devenu Fendeval ou encore il parle de la rivière Argentine (aucune idée c'est quelle rivière/fleuve celle là)

je voulais chercher une carte qui aurait les nouveaux noms plutot que les anciens, ou encore un outil qui me permettrait soit de comparer à l'anglais, ou encore à l'ancienne traduction, mais je ne trouve rien!  la carte interactive ne tient compte que de la vieille traduction

bref, est-ce que vous avez connaissance d'un outil/site/carte qui pourrait m'aider à m'y retrouver dans les nom de lieux? les nom de personnages, ça va, c'est vraiment les lieux l'enjeu!

I’m doing my yearly X-max to NY’s rewatch of all all 6 extended editions, and I’m in the middle of An Unexpected Journey.

When Thorin looks at Gandalf and says, “where are you leading us?”

Gandalf just glares at him and says nothing.

All i can think is, “Dude, you involved yourself in something that Gandalf set it motion.  By hook or by crook, the greatest Maiar ever to exist accomplishes his goal, no matter what it takes, and won’t prevent you from exercising your Eru given free will for a single moment.  What did you think was going to happen?”


Also, random note:  In the wake of Morgoth’s fall, Sauron was captured by his Eönwë and commanded to return to Valanar for judgement, as Maiar are explicitly forbidding from passing judgement on other Maiar.

So, Gandalf the White, having been returned from death by Eru itself, passes judgment on Saruman, breaking his staff with a word, casting him from the order, and leaving him a mortal (with only the power of his voice left to him).

So, does that mean that Gandalf is no longer a Maiar?  Is he now a Valar?  Is he something in between?

lotr,"I lost my grandpa this year. He was like a second dad to me. And he often did feel more like my dad than my actual father at times when our relationship was strained when I was young (don't worry, me and my dad are closer than ever now). 

If I had to describe him physically, and not just saying he was one of the kindest and gentlest people you could meet: he was tall (6 foot something, taller than my dad), had a big bushy beard as long as I knew him, a very deep voice and he was a lover of nature. I always loved going on walks through the woods with him when I was little (and we came across a bear one time!). Now, who does this sound like? 

For me, it's Treebeard. My grandpa's voice wasn't as deep as his obviously, but all the above attributes, and the fact that he also had a cadence in how he spoke like Treebeard, made me immediately think of him when he came onscreen. And upon this realization is when I started to cry. So much that my roommate heard me and checked on me thinking I was having a breakdown, and I was.

I'm a filmmaker and I'm starting to think people have a misunderstanding of how to make a successful movie or show, especially in the fantasy genre. 

Fantasy media is a genre that almost requires an expensive budget to make the unbelievable believable. Only animation can achieve a lower budget. That being said you need your movie to be watched by as many people as possible to make your money back. 

I also believe following word-for-word source material is a surefire way to have a box office flop but a great fan score. Not want you want when your budget is hundreds of millions. These movies/shows aren't made for super fans that know the lore, they are made for as many people as possible to enjoy.  

Not sure about this subreddit, but I know there's a huge push against this so-called woke agenda in the media. The introduction of black characters and powerful women seems to rub people the wrong way (among other lore problems). What people don't understand is that it works, that's why Hollywood is doing it. Because that is what the mass audience wants to see, they just don't want an agenda behind it, just let it be. Meaning, let a black character be black, we don't need a monologue about racism in a story where that doesn't exist. House of Dragons did this very well. 

Just curious, do you guys believe an adaptation should be followed word for word despite losing money, or liberties are inevitable so that as many people as possible can enjoy?","In defense of ""The Rings Of Power""",1672437614

Personally, I feel like he would have developed the Fellowship a bit more maybe giving them another adventure or two, padded up Frodo and Sam’s story in Two Towers befor they reach the Black Gate, expanded on the lore surrounding Sauron and explain more about Mordor’s workings, maybe add some information about Haran, drawn out the Scouring of the Shire, and give a longer ending to the already long ending.

I am not. I was talking to a friend, and he mentioned there were flaws, and I said “Yes, but not that many,” and he told me that the biggest one is that there are no women. He felt ashamed when he read an article told him there were no women, and he had loved the book so much, he had never realized that it never featured female characters. I’ve never been bothered by this. I’m a woman. I still grew up with a mind loving fantasies. I still enjoy Tolkien without him adding ladies to every story. Perhaps some would get bored with all the bearded dwarves and such, but I read it like it’s a historical account. It just flows of the page, and I’ll read any fantasy or historical fiction novel with that much ease in writing. I don’t know.

However, in like the second chapter Gandalf also remarks that the ring did not intend to be picked up by hobbits, and that it must be the work of some other force. 

Having read a decent portion of the first book, I’m coming to understand that the world of Middle earth is insanely complex and there is so much shit at play.

lotr,"Something I notice when people talk about lord of the rings films is how the movies skip the fact Gandalf was away for 17 years and by the time Frodo left the shire he was 50, while I get it’s not that big of a deal (and let be honest it wasn’t that important) but let’s consider a few things that could lead to the 17 year time skip

1. Frodo not aging, we already saw this with gollum and Bilbo as both of them got extended lives due to the ring and Bilbo looking around 75 despite being 111, it’s not hard to say the same happened with Frodo and even if it wasn’t life extending magic there’s 50 year olds who still don’t look old, sure there’s Sam, Merry and Pippin who are younger but apart from pippin they would have been in their 20s

2. Barad Dur still being under construction, we see in the film that after Frodo gets the ring, the tower is both still being constructed but also only as far as the hill top, and when they’re at Bree and the forests the tower is completed, but then again these could just be future visions like when Gandalf tried to pick the ring up

Overall it is confusing on whether or not a 17 year time skip did occur or not in the films but in my personal opinion it’s likely a skip did occur but not as long, but overall too I think that the 17 years was not that important to the plot, I get alot of the confusion also is due to Thranduin telling Legolas to find Aragon despite Aragon being like 10 years old but let’s be honest if you take the Hobbit films seriously that was your first mistake",Theory: the 17 year time skip still occurs in the film,1672252011

The problem is I just can’t get over some of the writing and details that I think make the show so much worse than it could’ve been.

1.) at one point Adar says summon the legions. A legion should be… one legion is 4,000-6,000 men…and by him saying legions it should’ve been a massive army of orcs. Instead it’s a couple of hundred and they get owned by the lame ass human village.

2.) does numenor not have an army? They make it look like it’s a bunch of ordinary citizens going to protect the queen. Also, they’re all training in the town square like it’s a little show. And to make matters worse….they only use 3 ships? 

3. The Mordor PowerPoint, I mean…cmon lol 

4.) the whole halbrandt thing. Did he mean to be in the middle of the ocean? Or is it just luck? Regardless, stupid way of introducing Sauron.

lotr,"What I don‘t understand in Tolkiens work is the concept of evil and the responsibilities evil acts have on the person who executes it. 
Let me explain: IIRC when Morgoth longed for the silmaril he started to manilpulate the Noldor. His dark whispers created the concept of evil inside the hearts of the elves. Greed, hubris and selfish pride where emotions/ thoughts the elves didn‘t know before. Am I right? Morgoth brought evil to Arda and everything he touched got infested with it. 
I know his whispers fell on fertile ground with the Noldor, but only his interference caused the distrust for the Valar and the following desaster. So the kinslaying was a direct consequence of Morgoth‘ actions.

The kinslaying was cruel, yes, but was it right for the Valat to punish the Noldor that hard? Wouldn‘t it be wiser to forgive and show them right way? Especially when the Valar should be wise enough to know that the Elves wouldn‘t stand a chance against Morgoth on the long run? 
I find it odd for them to say „Nope. You don‘t fit our society of white heroes anymore. Go f urselves and see how you will handle YOUR consequences!“ when all of this was caused by one of their kind. I don‘t get it. It feels wrong. Especially if you look onto the suffering that the Noldor got back thousandfold afterwards. The children of Illuvatar did not know evil until Morgoth told them. The Valar were their to guide elves and men.

I‘d really like to hear your approaches on this topic.",Evil and forgiveness,1673560799

Maybe it's that nostalgia that makes me a little biased, but I feel like the soundtrack genuinely captured the essence of Middle-Earth, especially the Shire and One Ring themes.

When I found an audiobook that plays samples of the music score in the background, I felt greatly more immersed in Tolkien's world, especially the scenes in Baggend.

I find the Shire's music to be both relaxing and comforting, but at times it proposes a spirit of wonder at times. Perhaps even a bit adventurous. The inclusion of the violin makes old timey and rustic while the flute gives it the feeling of people who are closer to nature. It overall feels simple, but still promises fullness. If that makes sense.

Then I feel the One Ring's theme creates vibes of something old and until recently lost. It feels charming yet oddly sinister. Ask if the darkness behind it is more subtle than anything else.

One aspect of Gandalf's character that I find particularly interesting is his decision to spare Saruman at the end of The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Many readers may see this as a weakness in Gandalf's character, but I believe that it is a crucial part of his development.

Gandalf is not a vengeful or cruel character. Throughout the trilogy, he is shown to be a wise and compassionate leader, and his decision to spare Saruman reflects this. Gandalf understands that Saruman is no longer the powerful wizard he once was, and that he is now a broken and bitter old man. Instead of punishing him, Gandalf chooses to have mercy on him and allow him to live out the rest of his days in peace.

Furthermore, Gandalf's decision to spare Saruman also shows his commitment to the greater good. He recognizes that it is more important to focus on the defeat of Sauron and the restoration of peace in Middle-earth, rather than seeking revenge on a fallen enemy.

In conclusion, Gandalf's decision to spare Saruman is not a weakness, but rather a demonstration of his wisdom, compassion and his commitment to the greater good. By sparing Saruman, Gandalf is showing his wisdom in understanding that Saruman is no longer a threat, his compassion in not wanting to punish a broken man and his commitment to the greater good in focusing on the defeat of Sauron and the restoration of peace in Middle-earth.",Why Gandalf's decision to spare Saruman is a crucial part of his character development,1673406197

Titan was dead. The pieces of land were moving around the sky, there was no green to be seen nor any living thing that walked or flew in the air. The seas, rivers and lakes seemed like they boiled. 
Only because they did not listen to him. 

*We could have ended this. If you weren't all so stubborn, we could have ended this. All would live, children would finally taste bread and the sky would be clear. But you destroyed it. All of you!*

That was it. He tried to fight back then. No longer now. It is over.

""I am done."" he said, looking over the wasteland. ""Maybe death will be kinder.""

""I am not so certain. Death is too final, is it not?""

He jumped. 
""Who is that?""

""Patience, my friend."" Thanos froze. The voice tha spoke to him was ancient, wise...and melodic and beautiful. ""Rashness is what cost your kind life, did it not?""

The person who stood before him resembled a Terran. But only slightly. They were tall and majestic to look at. Long white hair and a the ageless face made them seem like a god of Terran myths. A specimen of physical perfection. But most impressive (and terrible) thing Thanos noticed were the eyes: eyes of flame and ash, yet holding wisdom beyond time and space itself. And why they? Thanos could not guess what this was: male or female. But it looked androgynous, as if, as if...

*As if body is just a garment they wear, not important to them.*

Thanos fell to his knees.

The Stranger smiled. ""Oh...we have had a bit of a problem, have we not?""

Tha voice tone sounded like that of a male. He, then.
""Who...who are you?"" was all he could ask. ""Are you...a god?""

Thanos never believed in them. Not until now.

The Stranger passed by him, touching him on his bald head. ""It could be put that way. I was here before all things. Before Asgardians, before your masters and before even the Cosmos itself."" he smiled again. ""*All* of Cosmos.""

Thanos narrowed his eyes. ""You...you knew this would happen?"" he straightened up and clenched his fist. ""You let this happen?""

""Pardon, Thanos. Do not be so angry, my friend. What could have I done?"" he shrugged. ""Nothing but observe. You were right: your plan of random elimination would have saved the planet, but they did not listen to you. If they did, they would be alive right now.""

He sat upon a rock. His fair appearance and...cleanness made everything around him seem pathetic, weak, filthy and ruined. As if a dead world already wasn't those things. Even the way he was keeping his right hand behind or in his robe made him look more...divine.

Thanos grunted when he realized what the Stranger said. *He knows my name.* ""No. They didn't listen to me.""

""And what you predicted came to pass."" The Stranger reached out with his hand and, in little sparks, a cup filled with a red liquid was formed. Thanos backed away again, glancing at it, expecting a poison.

""Do not be disturbed, Thanos."" he drank from one side of the cup. ""It is a drink from Earth, my friend. You would like it.""

Reluctantly, he took it and drank a bit of it. The taste was sweet, but odd. ""Are you from Earth?"" 

The Stranger waved in a dismissive gesture. He did it with such boredom, as if everything around him was ashes compared to him. ""That little world is like as an ant is to you. Sure, they are ants who can talk, so they sometimes get my attention because of that, but otherwise, no. It could not mean less to me.""

""Xandar?""

""Now, they are rats that might be useful at something, but still no.""

""Then who are you?"" Thanos asked.

""Ah."" he almost scoffed, but from his mouth it sounded elegant. ""A good question. I have always wondered how to explain when some of you ask me. In an as accurate way as possible, without your mind being unable to understand it.""

Thanos groaned. ""I don't like riddles!""

""Ah, good!"" the Stranger waved again. ""They cost me much a thing at one point. But, let us not talk about me, Thanos: how about you? What will you do now?""
Thanos eased his temper and looked around, seeing he chaos, ruin and death that was around him. He stood up, sighing. ""Die."" he said. ""I will stay and die here.""

""Oh, please."" he said. ""As I have told you: death is so...final. Why not use the time and resources you have for something else?""

""Resources?"" he looked back at his guest, with gnashes teeth. ""My home is gone.""

""You still have established property in other systems. You do not have nothing.""

""My home and people are gone!"" he mouthed, turning away. He had cousins all around the universe actually: Eternals. Thena was the closest one and he even had a brother, Eros. But his people who raised him and his home from childhood: they were gone. ""I have nothing else to live for.""

""Untrue."" the Stranger repeated and crossed his legs. ""For example, you could make sure nothing like this ever happens.""

Thanos turned. ""How?""

""Quite simply, actually."" he said and smiled. ""Just do it with your own hand: eliminate half of life in the universe and all peoples will live to see another day.""
He stared at him for a time. He said it as if he was talking about changing garments and then going to the toilet to release oneself. 

""You're insane."" he said honestly. ""There is no such power anywhere in the universe.""

""No!"" the Stranger stood up and smiled again. ""Incorrect! Again. It is possible: definitively so. In fact, as easy as drinking water. You just need a couple of things to fulfill the task and make it mean something.""

""Yes. I totally believe you."" he himself almost smiled, though he did not find it funny at all. ""Please, enlighten me: what is it?""

""The Infinity Stones."" 

Thanos froze at the mention that. The story as old as time: Infinity Stones, that came to be at the very beginning of the universe, representing its aspects. It was said even one stone would give an individual incredible power. Countless people looked for them, fewer obtained them: it is said in stories that even Celestials, the masters and constructors of Thanos' ancestors, looked for them and desired them. 

*There are six of them, he thought, Space, Time, Mind, Reality, Power and Soul.*

""Myths."" he sighed. ""Lies of ancient people. They never existed.""

""Really?"" the Stranger walked slowly and gracefully, not making even a small sound. ""Then why"" he reached out with his right hand. ""am I holding one in my hand?""

The Titan backed away. In the Stranger's hand was a small, beautiful stone, shinning with the light of yellow star. He felt it speak to him. Calling him. Thanos had no words. He just stared at it, then at the Stranger.

""You,"" the Stranger smiled. ""already understand that this might be the only way to do it: if you eliminate half of all life, the other half will thrive and live in prosperity. You thought of that yourself, did you not?""
They called him a madman, but he knew it was true: for life to survive at all, one half needs to die. And I was right, even just on my planet.

""It is a pity what happened to your world. It was beautiful. But there are other worlds out there, with children born, living and dying in hunger. Those worlds are just as beautiful as yours was. Would you want others to die too?""

He thought about it. Power to save everyone, by myself. He could not protect his own, but he could protect others. He looked at the stone, uncertain what he admired more: its beauty or the power it will bring. 

Then he remembered who held it.

""How?"" he pointed at him, accusing him. ""Who are you? Your name: now!""

The Stranger shrugged again. ""I told you: someone who wants to help you.""

""I might be desperate, but I am not a fool."" he hissed. ""What do you want?""

""You are insulting me, Thanos!"" he laid his hand upon his chest in protest. ""My desire is nothing more than for you to succeed. You see, our objectives are merged with one another.""

He tilted his head. ""Our objectives?""

""Yes. Yours, mine...and my master's, of course."" 
He blinked. This creature, standing in front of him, looking like a god in mortal world, had a master he served. ""Your master?""

""Indeed."" he smiled. ""Surprised? Oh, well, you see Thanos, the most impressive and gifted creatures recognize the greatness of those above them. My master, you see, is the Great Lord: Lord of Highest Places and the Master of Fates. A great power that belongs to **him** is rightfully **his** and the Great Throne is **his** dwelling place. I, on the other hand..."" he shrugged. ""You can think of me as **his** High Priest.""

""And what does your...lord want?"" Thanos asked with despise in his voice. He always hated religious fanatics. *This one is not a god, but surely presents himself as one.*

The Stranger looked at the moon closest to Titan. Even it was red as blood.
""We have enemies: my master and I. You might have heard of them and, if you have not, you will, under right, or, should I say, wrong circumstances. They call themselves the TVA."" his face twisted in disgust. ""A group of fools who think too highly of themselves and who stand as annoying insects at your neck.""

""What is their crime?""

""They are keeping some of my colleagues back. But more importantly, they are keeping my master at bay.""

Thanos chuckled. ""Who'd you call him: Lord of Highest Places? Right... If he is so powerful, how come he is held by that group?""

""A group can hold a great beast in chains. Does that mean they are greater than the beast?""

Thanos' smile disappeared. ""No.""

""Indeed. I would even say one only fears that which is greater than him. Nevertheless, in this they succeeded: others are out there and my master cannot take physical form in the Cosmos. Only I am able to step into reality and only I am able to touch it. So master chose me as *his* voice and *his* eye in the Cosmos.""

Thanos looked back at the Stone, his eyes basking in its glory.

""And this,"" the Stranger grinned. ""is how you will help me. Go and find them: the Infinity Stones. They are the very weapons keeping my master chained outside of the Cosmos or, as some of you would call it, the Multiverse. Do with them what you will: bring balance, bring peace, bring bread and breath to the entire universe and you will be its Saviour!"" he raised his finger to point out. ""There is one condition, only one thing you will need to do to return the favor to me: when you are done with your mission, you will destroy the Stones.""

Thanos' jaw dropped. ""What?""

""You heard me well: destroy them. All of them. Reduce them to dust and ash. That will be enough to accomplish my master's desires.""

The Stranger's gaze cut Thanos deeper and was pulling him more than any word that he has spoken, or anyone ever, for that matter. The fiery eyes burned: burned for real. They daunted him and made him feel like a rat. He only had strength to make one response.

""Will it work?"" he asked. ""Do they have the power to do it? Will I be able to do it?""

""Absolutely!"" the Stranger said, almost laughing.  ""Once you have the Stones, it will be quick and easy. All you will have to do is this!"" he snapped his fingers. ""And half of all life will end, just as you intended. The only condition I give you is to destroy them. That is all we ask of you.""

""I don't care for power."" Thanos said. ""I will not care for Stones after they served their purpose.""

""Perfect. Then it will not be hard of you to destroy them."" 

Thanos glared at the Stone again. He could feel its power, its strength, its energy touching his mind and sending thoughts as if they were words. He could save the entire universe. He would not be a madman like they called him. *They would call me a Saviour.*

He took it.

""There, you see!"" the Stranger clasped with his hands. ""Then it is all arranged! We shall both get what we wanted.""

""You still didn't give me your name.""

The Stranger raised his right hand. Only now Thanos noticed it was missing one, index finger.

""I have had a fair share of them, but..."" he smiled. Smiled like a devil.

lotr,"Not necessarily which film is the best in either its theatrical or extended form (we all know that’s Fellowship of the Ring heh) but which film do you think is most improved by the additions of the extended scenes?

As much as I love the extended edition of Fellowship of the Ring, the theatrical cut of that film is also a god tier, 10/10 film that’s pretty much perfect. The extended cut hues a bit closer to the book and has a looser structure and more measured pace that recalls the writing of Tolkien, but since the film is a masterpiece in either form I’m not sure it greatly improves the theatrical cut.

Similarly, I consider Return of the King to be the most hit and miss of the three films in both the theatrical and extended cut. I think the extended cut does ultimately improve the film, we get Saruman’s resolution (even if the scene isn’t great the character deserved closure), some really great scenes like the houses of healing, Aragorn mastering the palantir (basically the conclusion of his character’s arc) a great scene with Frodo and Sam at the crossroads of the fallen king, as well as some great scenes in Mordor fleshing out their journey. And while I know many debate Aragorn beheading the mouth of Sauron you can’t deny it makes his line “For Frodo” that much more impactful. The additional paths of the dead scenes are kind of dumb, but I won’t throw out the baby with the bathwater. 

But ya know, I think Two Towers is the film that most improves with the extended edition. If I had a big knock against the theatrical cut of that film it’s that Jackson spent so much time focusing on Aragorn, Rohan, and the Battle of Helm’s Deep, he ended up relegating the hobbits to supporting roles. The extended edition fills out both Merry and Pippin as well as Frodo and Sam’s subplots very nicely, while also fleshing out our boy Faramir is some ways that greatly improve his character and storyline.

lotr,"-Sorry for bad translation- Fra to Eng.

I was 9 or 10 years old, it was in 2005 or 2006, I don't know exactly...

At that time, after school and during certain weekends, my friends and I used to go to a large park, near ruins, to play ""knights"", as they said.

No adults to watch us, no cell phones, no buildings, no roads, the immersion in our heroic marvelous universe was perfect.

There were about ten of us, boys and girls.  We had a lot of fun, I remember that the hours passed very quickly, too quickly.

In truth, we liked to mix all the universes that we liked at that time.

We had a lot of fun!  There were epic battles, knights equipped with wooden swords, magicians' staffs improvised with tree branches.

For the girls... Rather the princesses... The most miserable knights among us were transformed into magic horses, harnessed by jump ropes.

It was our universe, a mix of Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, our favorite cartoons and legends.

Me, I was a black magician, I was the bad guy.  My father, who is very handy, had made a magnificent magician's stick for me in a cherry branch during our holidays in Auvergne, enough to make all my friends jealous when I returned.

During a school trip, my older brother, meanwhile, had brought back a replica of the One Ring from Italy.

It wasn't mine but, although I wasn't allowed to use it, I really liked taking it on the sly to go and play in the park with my friends.

With this artifact in my possession, you can imagine that I was the most interesting.

Despite our young age, we liked to play in a very role-playing way, so I had become the most powerful, the strongest.

My friends were then particularly attracted by the precious.

And to avoid any effects of covetousness and envy by my comrades, I had crimped the One Ring at the end of my magician's staff.

So he was and would only be mine.

The battles were terrible, my magic was terrifying, growing, and the enemies bent under my power.

Until the day I stuck my stick in a cardboard shield.

In the heart of this park which was the scene of our confrontations, the ring had fallen.

It was only at the end of the battle, much too late, that I realized it...

Itt was then real tears that sprang from my body.

No more playing, it was no longer fun for anyone.

The cries of a child, who loses the object of the desire of all his comrades.

I had lost the Ring from Lord of the Rings!

Thus my friends helped me to search throughout the park, for hours, over several days, without ever finding the precious one.

That day, was it stolen from me?  I will never know.

A few years later, I returned to the park to remember the scenes of our heroic exploits, our merciless struggles, the countless losses, and the incessant marriages between knights and princesses, but also and above all to seek one last time the  'Ring.

I never found it, maybe it's still there?

Did someone, a child maybe, or worse an adult, find it before me?

They stole it from us.

He was mine. He is ours...

This has left me with the dvd choice of Blu-Ray or 4K to choose from, however, I don’t really know which one to choose, because I’ve heard there is good and bad aspects to both versions. I know that the Blu-Ray Extended version of Fellowship has the blue-green tint to it, that makes it wildly inconsistent with the Theatrical version, which would be a pain to dodge around in my editing process, but I also know that 4K has smoothed out a lot of the definition of certain shots, specifically LOTR. Though it seems to fix the tint issues for Fellowship, I’ve also noticed the 4K versions have made some other interesting color changes, such as making Smaug’s gold abrasively yellow. 

Ultimately I would like to hear everyone’s opinions on which version they prefer in order to help me make my decision. I did notice there was the Ultimate Collector’s Edition of the films, that had both Blu-Ray and 4K, which would solve my conundrum, but marked down, it’s still about $200.

What I noticed is that this plays in reverse. You clearly see the smoke going back into the house's chimneys while the scene passes. The banners blowing in the opposite direction the smoke moves. And if you start paying attention to it, the movement of those banners is very weird and not natural, because the scene plays backward. As is the movement of the lady's wardrope.

lotr,"When Gandalf calls Pippin a “fool of a took” many may have realized he just insulted Pippins entire family. But it goes deeper if you analyze the language a bit more. He is saying in less words the following ‘you are the biggest fool amongst an entire family of fools’. And yes in the books he did have that sentiment. But it goes deeper if you go back to the hobbit when Gandalf was looking for the 14th member he was looking for a hobbit that may have a bit of the old Took in him. The Took’s were known for being more adventurous (foolish in the eyes of other habits), kinder and more inquisitive. While the Baggins family was more stead fast, polite and learned. Bilbo was very well read mind you. Gandalf had a love hate real with the took household. He admired their willingness to go off on random adventures and the fact that Pippin was the most likely probably was a bit too much. Also if you take a closer look into Gandalfs action,  Pippin was the only one to receive harsh words from directly from Gandalf aimed directly at him. Yes he calls Denethor a madman but he says it to Pippin. Now if you believe this is because Gandalf hated Pippin and merely tolerated him. Or if you feel that Gandalf consoling Pipping numerous times in battle of Pelennor Fields shows that Gandalf was just frustrated his inquisitiveness and recklessness. Remember there is way more behind that “fool of a took” line.

Recently I rewatched all the extended editions of the Peter Jackson movies and I don’t know which one is my favorite now. Before rewatching them I would’ve said that fellowship was my favorite but now I’m not sure. Each film is so excellent and does things that the other 2 don’t do. Fellowship is so good at getting you sucked into the world and learning the characters and there’s a ton of emotion too. Two Towers continues the momentum and emotion that part 1 left off on in such a great way, and the journey with the characters is so good and satisfying to watch that it rivals the first film. Return of the King knocks it out of the park with concluding the story; showing where all the characters end up and how the story ends up in a very melancholy way.

lotr,"Tldr; Which order should I re-read all the books for the 2nd time. 1st time was Hobbit, LOTR, Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales.

Alright my fellow lotr friends. I am very close to barking upon my second ever re-read of Tolkein's works, and I am having a bit of a problem deciding which order to do things in.

First, allow me to say that as a young man, I loved the PJ film adaptation, and I am saving my rewatch of the trilogy for AFTER this re-read. I thoroughly enjoyed the movies and some PS2 or PS3 game I played back in the day, always wanted to read the books. As I grew older, I delved more deeply into the lore of various fantasy worlds (Star Wars, Star Trek, The Witcher, The Last of Us, Horizon Zero Dawn etc..) but I was always saving the best for last.

I knew that consuming Tolkein would be an adventure on it's own, but the more I delved into little YouTube videos about why the Hawks didn't fly The Fellowship to Mordor, or why Gimli was so devastated in Moria, I started remembering all the questions I've heard, with answers I didn't fully understand over the years.

-Why did Gandalf survive the fight with the Balrog?
-Why does the ring slip off fingers?
-Do Elves live forever?
-Who is Sauron?
-Who built all these ruins you see throughout the movies?


Whenever I heard the answer to these questions, it left me with MORE questions. What is a Maiar? What do you mean the Eagles aren't just Eagles? 

I am delighted to tell you that I have, slowly but surely, attained the answers to my life-long questions through both YouTube videos, and good old fashioned Tolkein at his finest.

I began my journey with The Hobbit, after learning about Tolkein's life experiences, I found it fascinating reading through this book with my new knowledge.

Continued with the Lord of The Ring. WOW! What an amazing set of books, I can't even begin - and won't bother to bore you - with describing the beauty of the world, and the talent which Tolkein so lovingly wrote this amazing piece of masterful literature. Finally gave me my proper introduction to the story how it SHOULD be told.

I bravely followed this up with The Silmarillion. I was always intimidated by this series of stories the most. However with a little bit of YouTube summaries to help hash out the finer details, I would like to think I had a pretty good understanding of what happens in the three ages, from an overall perspective. I may not be quite to the level where I can always name names and events or places correctly, but I understand the Creation myth, I understand the First and Second age events overall and the Third Age just kinda flew by. I found The Silmarillion to be very well written (notnthat it means anything coming from me) and although st times a tad taxing, I did find the varied and intertwined stories to be compelling.

Now I am nearly 2/3 of the way through The Unfinished Tales. Tying up the loose ends I have always wanted to know about. I loved the tale of Turin, I feel I am getting substantially better at reading Tolkein and understanding his flow at this point. I am cherishing the last bit of Tolkein's tales before I have finished.

Now, the re-read order I am considering is beginning with  The Silmarillion, The Hobbit, LOTR and any Unfinished Tales I want to hear again.

Should I go in this order? Or should I cut right to the juice and go straight back in to the whimsical nature of The Hobbit I've been missing these past 30 years of my life.

I’ve been thinking about just going ahead and starting Shadow of War next, but I haven’t really collected all of the artifacts or completed all of the weapon quests.

Also as a side question, what’s the general consensus of this game and its story? I’m not very big in the lotr fanbase and have only a bit of knowledge on the lore so I don’t know if this game is considered a black sheep or considered amazing by the fan base. Personally enjoyed the game a decent bit and thought the nemesis system as a whole was a cool concept. Plus commanding Uruks and the different beasts was really fun.

One thing I'm curious about, I don't recall from the books, and I haven't found an answer searching this forum, but this particular name I mention above.

I understand the implications of what ""Stormcrow"" represents and I believe Grima also makes the same implication in the movies.  Was Gandalf referred this way in Rohan and in Edoras in the years prior to him arriving in Edoras with the members of the Fellowship (absent Samwise and Frodo) or is this only a title thrust on him by Théoden while under the influence of Saruman?

When riding into Rohan, as Gimli says ""you'd find more cheer in a graveyard"" but I'm not sure if this is a product of the displeasure of seeing Gandalf come to town, a product of the current scenario in Rohan, or both?

Additionally, when counseling Théoden, at least in the film, the king gives a tepid glance at Gandalf as Gandalf counsels him.

But Anglachel has always stood out to me as having a very sword and sorcery feel. Much more than the rest of The Legendarium. This is from [a rather long essay I wrote](https://www.blackgate.com/2018/04/02/tolkiens-magic-sword-anglachel-2/) on Anglachel:

TURIN SPOILER AHEAD (Though you should know Turin's tale if you're reading this)

 'While magic swords are common in the modern fantasy/RPG world, they  were rare and prized in Middle Earth. Anglachel could cut through iron  and it glowed with a pale fire, which truly marked it as a wondrous  blade. It was also sentient, though that is not revealed until the end  of its tale. Horrified to discover that Niniel was really his sister,  Turin addressed the sword:

&gt;“Hail Gurthang! No lord or loyalty dost thou know, save  the hand that wieldeth thee. From no blood wilt thou shrink. Wilt thou  therefore take Túrin Turambar, wilt thou slay me swiftly?’ “

And from the blade rang a cold voice in answer:

&gt;“Yea, I will drink thy blood gladly, that so I may forget  the blood of Beleg my master, and the blood of Brandir slain unjustly. I  will slay thee swiftly.”

By mentioning Brandir’s unearned death and speaking of loyalty to  Beleg, Gurthang’s words indicate that it wasn’t animated by the essence  of Eol. The sword wants to allow Turin to right his wrongs by letting  him kill himself. This is quite different from the dark malevolence of  Elric’s Stormbringer, which delights in stealing the souls of the albino  prince’s friends. Stormbringer is revealed to be a demon, and it speaks  to Elric at the end of the epic saga, “I was a thousand times more evil  than thou!”

However, if we dismiss Eol’s dark character as the source of  Anglachel’s intelligence, there is no other indication of where the  sword drew its abilities from. We could infer it was a combination of  Eol’s craftsmanship and the meteorite iron, but that’s just pure  guesswork.'

lotr,"  Sigh. What is there to say about *The Two Towers* other than “What a fucking mess.” 

At least with *Fellowship*, you can pick apart the elements that Jackson, Boyens &amp; Walsh “improved” and explain why they feel so disrespectful to the books. There are also moments (a few) that genuinely *feel* like Tolkien.

This film is mostly just 8 hours of stupid crammed into a 4-hour bag. It’s impossible to truly analyze what’s wrong with this film because so little is right. In that regard, I’ll just stick with the broadest of strokes.

People in this forum often challenge me as to why I dislike the PJ films so much, so, by request, here’s a breakdown of what I find so offensive about the Extended Edition of *The Two Towers…*

*•* *•* *•*

*:03 Gandalf &amp; The Balrog fall for an hour…*  
 Okay, I promised not to nitpick but I kinda can’t resist. I know Gandalf said, “Long time I fell, and he fell with me,” but there’s a difference between “A long time” and “Holy shit, still falling.” Gandalf and the Balrog fall for 71 seconds. For the record, that’s a fall of over 15 miles. I *think* that’s probably excessive.

*:04 Sam &amp; Frodo…*  
 I will admit, now that PJ&amp;W are forced to treat them as main characters, Frodo and Sam are suddenly a lot closer to their book personalities. Without all the Important Characters to look after them, PJ has no choice but treat Sam &amp; Frodo like adults. Sam is capable, and Frodo is no longer a cringing coward, paralyzed by fear, and it’s refreshing. For this first bit, before JB&amp;W start “fixing” the plot, this actually feels like *Lord of the Rings*.

*:14* *Sméagol promises nothing…*  
 An incredibly important moment JB&amp;W either didn’t understand or didn’t care about. Sméagol has to **speak his promise to the Ring**. That’s how the magic, the control, the prophecy of it works. 

“Sméagol will swear never, never, to let Him have it. Never! Sméagol will save it,” and “I will serve the master of the Precious!”

Sméagol **must** say these things (or something close to them) to build for himself the clever trap that forces his own doom. The Ring compels the completion of both of these oaths. In the film all he says is “I will serve the master…” but that’s nothing.

*:18 Orc noses and Aragorn’s intuition…*  
 Not only can orcs climb down walls once per movie, they can also scent men an entire day’s run away (once per trilogy, because they never smell anyone who might surprise or overtake them again). And then Aragorn *instantly* knows the orcs have scented them! 

*:20 “And the union of the Two Towers…”*  
 STOP putting the fucking title into dialogue, Jackson, you hack! It is completely stupid and unnecessary. Of course this is followed by the most absurdly arch order to burn Fangorn that Christopher Lee could possibly contrive. *This thing will be your undoing; let’s say it out loud to make sure everyone knows you’re destroying all the trees!*

*:22 Burn this pointless village! We need an action scene!*  
 It really is so dumb. Yes, Saruman was able to raise the wild hillmen and the Dunlendings, but we didn’t need to waste the screen time watching this village being attacked.

It is also a really ham-fisted way to introduce characters to show Éomer finding Théodred (who was supposed to have been 41, BTW, not this pretty boy) just to take him home to die. We shouldn’t be meeting these characters until our leads meet these characters. It’s just crappy storytelling.

*:25 The Grima &amp; Théoden Show…*  
 There’s a part of me that really thinks Jackson was playing these characters as comic relief. Both Théoden and Wormtongue are presented in such ridiculous, over-the-top, comic-opera extremes he cannot possibly have wanted this to taken seriously. Here’s Théoden from the book:

“Upon it sat a man so bent with age that he seemed almost a dwarf; but his white hair was long and thick and fell in great braids from beneath a thin golden circlet set upon his brow. In the centre upon his forehead shone a single white diamond. His beard was laid like snow upon his knees; but his eyes still burned with a bright light, glinting as he gazed at the strangers.”

Compare that to the old man who cannot even open his eyes and speaks only to Wormtongue in unintelligible mumbles. Again, JB&amp;W have proven they have literally zero subtelty. Every element must be heightened to the point of utmost stupidity. The Rohirrim are a proud, warrior people. Is it plausible that they would still follow a doddering old man who could neither stand nor speak? Everything about this version of Théoden and Wormtongue is ludicrous.

Then, when Éomer steals Gandalf’s thunder about Grima’s price, Jackson ACTUALLY HAS WORMTONGUE LOOK AT ÉOWYN! Is this a student film? 

Next, guards come to beat the crap out of Éomer. Who are these guys? Are they being paid by Wormtongue? They certainly wouldn’t act like this simply on his say. Again, for this rotten kingdom ploy to work, Théoden has to be the puppet, not a slobbering pile of suet.

*:31 The Riders of Rohan attack in the dumbest possible way…*  
 Guess the orc’s noses don’t work at night because they failed to smell horsemen and horses. I recognize there wasn’t the screen time for the Riders to harry and surround the orc band as they do in the book, but having them display even rudimentary knowledge of tactics for attacking from horse would have been nice. Instead, they just blunder in. At night when the orcs have the advantage of visibility. And use bows at close range with their own guys running around. But, yeah, what did I expect?

*:40 Treebeard kills Grishnak…*  
 I *really* hate this introduction of Treebeard. Not because it isn’t what happens in the book, but because it’s completely out of character. It is an incredibly *hasty* act, and gives the wrong impression of how Ents behave (or how Ents *should* behave) right out of the gate. Immediately, he involves himself in the affairs of the other races.

Yes, Treebeard hates orcs, but in the book he suspects Merry and Pippin of being orcs and waits to decide. This version of Treebeard doesn’t even jibe with the one we see later at the Entmoot who is so passive he has to be tricked into attacking Saruman.

*:42 The Dead Marshes…*  
 The Marshes the way it was written in the book is so much more cinematic than what ended up onscreen, it’s bizarre that Jackson changed it. In the original, the initial entry takes place after dusk, and the lights (which are referenced in the film but never seen; maybe an effect never got finished?) are all around. The faces are much more dimly visible and hypnotic. Then the wraith flies over and the lights go out. It’s a *great* visual. 

Instead, JB&amp;M had to have their second zombie moment, and instead of being glamoured, Frodo falls in and is assaulted by shrieking undead faces and it’s all shtick we’ve seen a hundred times. PJ did it better in *The Frighteners*.

Immediately after this, Frodo lies there masturbating the Ring. Because even the draw of the Ring had to be loud and stupid. Instead of fighting until almost the end, we’re literal screen *hours* away from Mt. Doom and Frodo has already lost the battle. IT’S TOO FUCKING MUCH, PETE!

*1:05 The Elven cloaks are from Harry Potter…*  
 Of *course* Sam falls off a cliff near the Black Gate and of *course* two Easterlings come to investigate. Frodo wraps them in his Elven cloak and the observant Easterling stops three literal inches from the hem of the cloak and yet, in broad daylight, cannot see them. It is so over-the-top dumb I was expecting Frodo to have grown a lightning bolt-shaped scar when he finally opened the cloak (which has become a much larger molded stone covering).

*1:10 Merry &amp; Pippin are still idiots, and Old Man Willow is in the wrong film…*  
 Why do Merry &amp; Pippin have to have a scrambling pratfall argument about Merry drinking the Ent draught. Can’t Merry just… drink the fucking water…? Do we have to *witness* them growing, complete with gassy sound effects? 

And then here’s Old Man Willow, fresh from The Old Forest, just in time to make it seem like Treebeard isn’t even in charge of the trees *in his own Enthouse*, much less the rest of the forest. Because heaven forfend we go more than 4 minutes without a forced, unmotivated action sequence.

*1:19 The scuffle before Théoden’s throne…*  
 It’s been five minutes. Time for ACTION! Instead of allowing Gandalf to command the room, as he does in the book, the men of Théoden’s house rush in for a quick fistfight with Aragorn and the boys while Gandalf *actually casts the spell* to release Théoden. The subtle elegance of the book, *did Gandalf use magic or just psychology to get Théoden out of his chair?* We can’t have that. 

No, in Jackson’s world, Gandalf has to actually say “I release you from this spell!” But that’s not enough! No, he has to light the room with his white cloak, and apply electro-shock with his staff, jolting Théoden in his chair Once! Twice! Thrice! Complete with sound effects and a cutaway to Saruman flying across the room!

It is. So. Dumb.

In this world, Théoden is a barbarian king and wants to kill Wormtongue, depriving him of the delicious guile he displays in offering Wormtongue mercy by offering to let him ride into battle. Then, Jackson sets up Aragorn to immediately undermine Théoden’s renewed authority by stopping him from exercising his vengeance. The only person in this scene with motivations that make sense is Wormtongue.

*1:30 Helm’s Deep is a stupid idea…*  
 Nothing that happens in Jackson’s film after Gandalf Abracadabras Théoden makes sense. In the book, he counsels Rohan to make war against Saruman so the threat of Isengard will not be on the flanks of Gondor. They ride out, hoping to reach the Ford of Isen before the defense there has faltered, but they are too late. Word reaches them of the rout, and they fall back to Helm’s Deep at Gandalf’s urging.

In the movie, they spend a long time burying Théodred (whom the audience never knew, and there was no narrative gain to having alive at all), after which Théoden refuses to ride to war, and instead heads directly for Helm’s Deep (with *all* his people), which Gandalf thinks is a terrible idea. This is just pointless meddling with the story to add needless conflict between Gandalf &amp; co. and Théoden, and it makes the plot pointless. 

Apparently, in this movie, there are no keeps in Dunharrow? Why would Théoden then not simply head for Minas Tirith? Wormtongue makes a point of telling Saurman the road to Helm’s Deep is dangerous and slow. No one has any clear motivations at this point; it’s just a bunch of word salad designed to get to a huge battle, which is Jackson’s only goal for this film.

*1:35 Aragorn absolutely leads Éowyn on pointlessly…*  
 In the book, Aragorn is incredibly careful not to flirt with Éowyn. He recognizes that she wants him, and he gently, but firmly, shuts her down. It’s noble and honest. A bit cold-hearted, but he is part Elven (well, in the book; Viggo has a beard so Jackson’s Aragorn is plainly 100% human, but whatever). 

Here, Jackson has Aragorn flirting with absolute intent, just to say later, “oh, sorry dummy, my heart is taken.” It’s a shitty bro-move, and unworthy of the character.

*1:45 The Hobbits are idiots again…*  
 Sam &amp; Frodo’s brief time of being capable adults is all done, because now there are Important Humans about. While in the book, they realize Faramir’s men are near and hide, leaping out to make an impossible stand and thus impressing Faramir and his men, PJ has them bumbling into Faramir, falling on their asses and begging for mercy. No bold bravery here, just pathetic little people.

*1:55 PJ Sends in THE WARG RIDERS!*  
 What is there really to say about this stupid, pointless warg rider attack? Obviously, JB&amp;W felt they had gone too long without an Action Sequence! so we get this. It does nothing to forward the story, depletes Théoden’s forces to a comically small number, and inserts the so, so absurd “Aragorn is dead! He fell off a cliff!” beat. Everything about this is wrong.

The whole sequence ends with Wormtongue saying “But my lord, there is no such force!” only to be shown Saruman’s army arrayed below, so there must be some secret hidden entrance into Isengard because somehow Wormtongue didn’t pass or see these “tens of thousands” of orcs on the way in.

*2:10 Elrond prophesies Arwen’s ending…*  
 I actually really appreciate them including Arwen’s miserable end from the Appendices; a lot of people never read them, and fail to understand how few happy endings there are in Tolkien’s world. Most roads lead to sorrow. My only complaint is that it is so cheesily done, with Hugo Weaving chewing all the scenery and spitting it right into the camera. With even the slightest touch of subtelty, this moment woulda been beautiful.

Then, of course, it all goes to shit with Galadriel’s telepathic infodump (to Elrond, I guess?) for those who haven’t been following along. 

And, of course, Anborn knows Théoden has taken his people to Helm’s Deep even though there’s literally no way they could know this. Also, apparently, Osgiliath *just fell*; in his flashback, Denethor tells Faramir “but for you, this city would still be standing.” 

Weird because Osgiliath was ruined 500 years earlier, and looks it, and Faramir doesn’t seem quite that old. Gondor had retaken both banks about 20 years earlier, but then lost the east bank a year before the movie. Not sure what this memory is of them reclaiming Osgiliath. Just an opportunity for Denethor to be a dick.

*2:30 Faramir is just another thug…*  
 Tell me again how Peter Jackson does not have complete contempt for Tolkien’s characters? Faramir is *different* from Boromir. That is the entire point. That is why Denethor despises him. Faramir has studied with Gandalf, has a mind for history and strategy, and Faramir is not arrogant. But Jackson can’t abide subtlety or shades of grey, or the Faramir, who encounters the ring and turns it away, saying “Not if I found it on the highway would I take it.”

*This* Faramir lets his guards kick the shit out of Gollum. This Faramir is shifty and untrustworthy. This Faramir declares the Ring will go to his father, even *knowing* Denethor would become a tyrant if given it. Because in Peter Jackson’s universe, the Ring would already have won and Frodo been killed for it because *all* men are *instantly* susceptible.

Following this, Aragorn finally rejoins the movie already in progress, having taken a pointless little holiday in the river Isen.

*2:45 The Fucking Goddamned Elven Archers…*  
 No. No, Peter. You do not get to ignore *everything* about Tolkien’s lore and go unscathed. The elves Do. Not. Fight. This. Fight. For all the reasons you ignored, and everyone else already knows. The elves are leaving the fighting to men. Period. Fuck you and Fran and Philippa for deciding to include them. Absolutely no. The Last Alliance was the LAST. You DO NOT get to make a NEW one.

Worse, they are from “Elrond of Rivendell,” but they’re archers of Lorien, so it doesn’t make any logical sense either.

SO much is so dumb about this battle sequence. Relegating Gimli to comic relief status by putting him on the battlement, where he would never be in the first place. How easily the wall is overrun. The orcs being so much stronger than men as opposed to relying on strength in numbers. The orc running with the Olympic flame. The breach in the wall being replaced by a huge explosion (with Aragorn on top of it, naturally). Gimli jumping directly onto a field of upraised spears and missing all of them. The archers charging, instead of, y’know, shooting arrows. The Dwarf tossing. The ridiculous giant siege ladders going up fully loaded.

The goddamned shield. How did any of you ever forgive Legolas and the goddamned shield?

*2:58 The Ents decide not to go to war…*  
 I’m guessing primarily because they decided yes in the book. And, of course, because no one gets to be heroic but the heroes, so we have to set it up that Pippin *directly* leads the Ents to war.

*3:11 Faramir drags Frodo to Osgiliath…*  
 Just the cherry on top of making Faramir a myopic dickhole in this version. He sends the Hobbits off to Denethor, which means he *was* resisting the power of the Ring. He didn’t try to take it for himself. He is *choosing* to send it to someone he knows will do terrible things with it. But, yeah, JB&amp;W didn’t make any important changes to the characters at all…

*3:16 Gandalf returns with Éomer…*  
 So, the Elven archers (all of whom seem to have died by this point) were able to get here on foot from Lorien *before* Gandalf and the remainder of the Riddermark were able to arrive? Given that, in Jackson’s version, Gandalf brings these guys rather than the Huorns, this really seems like far too little, far too late. Especially since *none* of these horses would survive the charge down that hill.

Also, are both Éomer and Gandalf stupid enough to just charge into an entire wall of set pikes? Seriously, this is cavalry 101. Do Not Ride Into Pikes. Yeah, the sun comes up right behind the charge, but the pikes are still set. It’s SO DUMB.

*3:20 Frodo shows the Goddamned Ring to the Goddamned Nazgûl…*  
 If this isn’t proof that Jackson does not understand the story he is supposed to be telling, I don’t know what is. Right here, the movie is over (again). Frodo (now magically atop a tower) shows the Ring to one of the Nine. Sam saves Frodo, Frodo flips out and threatens Sam with Sting, Faramir shoots the fell beast with an arrow, and the Nazgûl **FLIES AWAY?!?**

None of that matters. Sauron now *KNOWS*, not suspects, not fears, but *KNOWS* the Ring is in Osgiliath, being carried by a Hobbit. The rest of the Nine would *instantly* descend on Osgiliath and tear it apart until the Hobbits were found. Even if that somehow failed to happen, it means ~~Gandalf’s~~  Aragorn’s feint at the Black Gates wouldn’t work. Sauron would know the Ring wasn’t with them. This moment completely and irretrievably breaks anything that comes after.

Then, in what I’m certain is a middle finger to people like me, Sam cries, “It’s all wrong! We shouldn’t even be here.”

That’s right, Sam. It is. And you shouldn’t.",Why I Hate the Films: Part II; The Two Towers (Extended),1672643830
lotr,"People in this forum often ask why I dislike the PJ trilogy so much. They assume it’s because things got cut; I get lectured about how you can’t translate an epic like LotR word-for-word, and I understand that. I’m a filmmaker. I never expected we would have Bombadil, or every moment of the trilogy represented.

What I didn’t expect was Jackson’s absolute disdain for the actual soul of the trilogy itself. When I watch these films, I see a lot of great work; the art department, costume department and makeup department obviously wanted to make *Lord of the Rings*, and, largely, they did a fantastic job. 

The script, however, displays obvious contempt for the characters and the world in which they live. At one point, in the Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens audio commentary for *Two Towers,* Boyens says, “Look, our version is just better!”

It's plain that was their attitude about the entire story, and it makes me sad. It makes me angry. Peter Jackson had all the tools at his disposal to do it right, and he pissed it away. No one in my lifetime will have this opportunity again.

I’m not interested in changing anyone’s mind, and you can save your “But dude, Legolas shield-surfing the stairs is AWESOME and I heard the book ends on a total downer!” comments as well. Downvote away. I’m not gonna stop saying the films are terrible, and I honestly don’t care about your arguments to the contrary. This just gives me an easy way to answer *why*. 

I have a lot of issues with the actual filmmaking choices Jackson made; photography, lighting, editing; but that isn’t what this is about. This is about *story*. Frankly, there are a million elements I could tear apart (i.e. *Dayum it’s bright as day in the caverns under the Misty Mountains… no wonder Bilbo found the Ring*), but I’m trying not to be too picky and focus solely on the things that really make me gnash my teeth. By request, here’s a breakdown of what I find so offensive about the Extended Edition of *Fellowship of the Ring…*

*•* *•* *•*

*:03 Elrond in the front lines…*  
 Why is Elrond literally the only warrior in the Last Alliance who couldn’t afford a helmet? This makes me crazy. It’s a little thing but it’s a good indicator of the kind of senseless cheats the next 12 hours are gonna be full of.

*:17 Gandalf prat-falls around Bag End…*  
 Right out of the gate, Jackson begins undermining Gandalf. These aren’t Tolkien’s characters, they are two-dimensional Fantasy Film Archetypes straight from Central Casting. Gandalf has to be a doddering old man because that’s what old men do; they walk into chandeliers and whack their heads on low door frames. Gandalf isn’t a demigod, he’s your absent-minded old uncle. That grinding sound is Tolkien spinning.

*:19 Bilbo hasn’t told Frodo his plan to leave…*  
 The choice for Bilbo to have not revealed his plan to Frodo is very odd. It makes Frodo seem gullible, and it also seems like Bilbo doesn’t trust Frodo, having not taken him into his confidence. It’s just extra story baggage that isn’t really true to the characters.

*:26 Gandalf is surprised by Bilbo’s party trick…*  
 Poor Gandalf. Even though he knows Bilbo better than probably anyone, even though he has plenty of time to see what Bilbo is doing, he is somehow caught unawares by Bilbo putting on the ring. In the book, of course, he adds a flash and bang to make it seem like a trick to mask Bilbo’s vanishing. But poor old movie Gandalf just isn’t that sharp so he sits there like a dunce.

*:27 “What about this ring of yours, is that staying too?”*  
 In the book, it is plain Gandalf approves of the party and the spectacle to make it easier for Bilbo to part with the Ring. That’s the entire plan. For some inexplicable reason, in Jackson’s universe, this is the first time the subject has come up?! So now, in the minute before Bilbo leaves, Gandalf has to browbeat him into parting with the Ring? Why? What narrative purpose does this *possibly* serve other than making Gandalf infinitely less wise than he is in the books? In this version, why wouldn’t Bilbo react as if Gandalf was trying to defraud him?

*:31* *Gandalf almost picks up the Ring…*  
 Had Jackson left the Ring on the floor to be encountered by Frodo when he walked in, it would actually have been a nice, relatively subtle indicator that Gandalf was afraid to touch it. Instead, we get this little waking nightmare with the flash on The Eye. At this point, in Jackson’s world, Gandalf should have no doubt, or, at the very least, much stronger suspicions that this is The One. At this point, it is cruel, criminal and negligent for Gandalf to allow Frodo to take it. But this is doddering Granddad Gandalf, so, of course he just backs away in fear and says “Keep it safe little dude.”

*:37 Gandalf is terrified and scares Frodo to death…*  
 I understand the drive to make the narrative more urgent by drastically condensing the length of time Gandalf is gone from The Shire, and the time Frodo has to plan, but having him return, losing his shit and literally jumping at shadows is just incredibly out of character. 

It also makes it completely irrational for Gandalf to then go off again. If he’s that afraid, he would never leave Frodo and the Ring. He even departs in the same direction as Sam and Frodo, and just abandons them in the forest instead of taking them with him to Rivendell and going from there to see Saruman. In condensing the timeline, Jackson, Boyens and Walsh have completely thrown out the logic.

*:48 Gandalf trusts Saruman…*  
 Oh simple, trusting, doddering Gandalf. In the book, Gandalf *never* trusts Saruman. He only goes to him at Saurman’s request, and even then, gives him no information. In the film, of course, Gandalf lays everything out like a simpleton. Then Saurman REVEALS TO GANDALF THAT HE HAS A PALANTÍR?!? Why would he ever do this? It is an instant admission of guilt and betrayal.

Then we have this stupid, *stupid* wizard battle. Ninety interminable seconds of Old Man WWF that ends with the most ridiculous spun-by-wires scene ever. This is the polar opposite of how magic works in Tolkien’s world. I am embarrassed for this film.

*:53 Frodo finally officially meets Merry &amp; Pippin…*  
 This is a huge thing that most people who love the films simply gloss over, but it changes the tone and tenor of everything that comes after. Before this, we have seen Merry &amp; Pippin precisely twice; once, being idiots stealing a firework to set it off themselves at the party, and again dancing on a table at The Ivy Bush.

Now we meet them stealing vegetables from Farmer Maggot, and Pippin says, “Merry! It’s Frodo Baggins!”

I don’t know why this change made sense to JB&amp;W, but in this version *Merry &amp; Pippin barely know Frodo*. They are, at best, casual, small-town acquaintances. They are absolutely *not* his best and oldest friends. Then, suddenly, they’re all just… together. But there is *absolutely no reason Merry &amp; Pippin would have gone with Frodo*. Yes, they’re mischievous young Hobbits interested in adventure, but this is actual pants-pissing danger. Absent the relationship that’s established in the book, nothing that follows between the four of them makes any sense at all. 

*:57 The Black Rider actually catches them in the forest…*  
 These Black Riders are so much more aggressive and unafraid of anything than they are in the books. One of them has already cut down the gate guard at the Brandywine Bridge in a quick shot. In the book, they are reticent to declare open war on The Shire and the Downlands. They avoid Maggot’s dogs; they attack the Prancing Pony by stealth. These Black Riders would just kill everyone and sift the bodies.

Setting that aside, at this moment, the movie is over. They are actually caught, in the open, by a Rider. Frodo manages to escape, at 3 ½ feet tall, running from a horse. The Rider doesn’t cut them down, doesn’t grab Frodo and pull him over his saddle. He just flails around. This moment is aggressively stupid.

*1:02 Frodo puts on the Ring at the Prancing Pony…*  
 As far as we know, this is the first time Frodo has ever put on the Ring, and instantly, he’s in nightmareland and Sauron INSTANTLY sees him. In the book, the real world fades a bit and hearing is sharpened; had this happened every time Bilbo put on the Ring, obviously, he wouldn’t have used it.

*1:03 Aragorn and Narsil…*  
 Now we’re getting to the point where JB&amp;W have fucked up the opening of the story so much that things are beginning to unravel, and will require a lot of pointless patchwork later on. Aragorn draws a sword here, but it isn’t Narsil. But why would it be? There’s no letter from Gandalf, and Butterbur barely knows him, so there’s no reference to the sword that was broken to give Aragorn his bonafides. 

Frodo simply… takes him at his word, which makes Frodo really dumb. In fact, in this version of the story, there’s no way Aragorn could have known to be looking out for the Hobbits in the first place. Gandalf abandoned them and rode hell-for-leather to Saruman, so who told Aragorn they were coming?

*1:04 The Riders assault on Bree…*  
 And in another Jackson “enhancement,” the Riders literally ride down an entire section of wall, crushing Old Harry underneath. Ahhh, subtlety. But after declaring themselves in this way, they don’t ransack the rest of the inn? They just… leave…?

*1:10 Saruman takes orders from Sauron…*  
 Here we see Saruman getting direct marching orders from Sauron. So we lose all the complexity of Saruman being a competing power and instead he’s simply a minion of Sauron. Makes everything that follows much more two-dimensional, and it’s unfair to Saruman whose arrogance assured him he was in control at all times. Clunky, clumsy, simple-minded.

*1:11 Aragorn hands out blades…*  
 Aragorn hands out four Hobbit-sized blades he just happened to be carrying. So not only did he magically know the Hobbits were coming, he magically knew *how many*, even though there’s no reason in the world Merry &amp; Pippin are still following.

*1:14 Aragorn fucks off and leaves the Hobbits to die…*  
 Everything that could be wrong with this scene is wrong. Aragorn goes to “have a look around,” and can’t be bothered to come back until everything is fucked. They are *supposed* to have a fire. Aragorn builds it in the dell at the top where it won’t be seen from below. The entire space in the film is much too small. 

The description in the books is artful; figures of dread and terror.

“Over the lip of the little dell, on the side away from the hill, they felt, rather than saw, a shadow rise, one shadow or more than one. They strained their eyes, and the shadows seemed to grow. Soon there could be no doubt: three or four tall black figures were standing there on the slope, looking down on them. So black were they that they seemed like black holes in the deep shade behind them. Frodo thought that he heard a faint hiss as of venomous breath and felt a thin piercing chill. Then the shapes slowly advanced.”

In the film four (then five) brightly-lit guys in black cloaks advance to so close to the cowering Hobbits it’s comical. Then, because every non-human in Jackson’s film must be Less Than Aragorn, Frodo just lies back terrified. He doesn’t call out the name of Elbereth (he doesn’t even know any lore, apparently), he doesn’t stab the Witch King, he doesn’t do anything but piss himself. Then, finally, Aragon appears in slow-motion with his generic sword and a torch (lit from what fire? Also, not a brand, and actual *torch*), *sets fire to two of them and actually fences with the others until they fucking flee because he’s just* ***that*** *badass*. Then the INCREDIBLY STUPID torch-throw that ignites the fifth Rider which then flees as well. 

This scene is just so *wrong*, so utterly and completely **not** from Tolkien’s books it would be comical if it wasn’t so painful.

*1:18 Shit-covered Lurtz and the Uruk-Hai*…  
 Yes, the Uruks had been bred to be bigger and less light-sensitive than regular orcs, but this is just absolutely ridiculous. They still only survive by strength in numbers, and trying to make a “super-orc” secondary villain is a cheeseball move.

*1:19 Arwen…*  
 Jesus, this… I get it. There aren’t a lot of women in LotR, and here’s Glorfindel just kinda hanging around not doing anything, so why not replace him? But this meet-cute moment with the sword in the forest, and Aragorn just chewing up the Athelas and mashing it into Frodo’s wound, it’s all so ham-handed. It’s like you told the story to an 8-year-old and then asked him to tell it back to you.

And, of course, because Frodo is just baggage in this movie, he cannot ride alone. He has to ride with Arwen so she can have this “Come and claim him!” moment. But we lose Frodo refusing the summons of the Riders, one of the most important moments of Frodo’s stoicism before reaching Rivendell. Instead, he’s just afraid and useless. 

Then Arwen calls the flood rather than Elrond releasing it, but she does it while they are *still in the water*. And doddering old Gandalf doesn’t even get credit for the horses in the foam.

*1:30 Elrond plots to manipulate Frodo…*  
 Elrond and Gandalf spy on Frodo and Sam, and it is obvious that Elrond expects Frodo to carry the Ring away from Rivendell. Frodo’s single most important moment of agency in the entire story is taken from him. Also, we see that Gandalf somehow recovered his staff from Saruman, but at this point, who cares about continuity?

*1:38 The Council of Idiots…*  
 Ohmigod this scene. What was originally a discussion of events and a council of war debated among the various representatives of the free peoples turns into Boromir almost taking the ring, Gandalf reciting the verse complete with Surround Sound &amp; Lighting Effects, Gimli trying to destroy it with his axe and everyone squabbling like children. 

JB&amp;W took something reasoned and intelligent and made it loud and stupid. I want to punch this scene in the teeth. I’m glad they removed Bilbo, he deserves better. Then they end it by fucking up Frodo’s most important moment so that he has to shout “I will take the Ring!” three times. No, quiet dignity and strength is only for Aragorn, silly Hobbit!

Followed by the awful “My sword! My bow! My axe” scene, because, in this version, they’re just volunteering rather than being chosen. And Merry &amp; Pippin, now **REALLY HERE FOR NO REASON**, declare they will have to be bound in a sack to keep them from going.

Then… oh god, then… they actually wrote down the fucking title and *made Hugo Weaving say it.* “You will be the Fellowship of the Ring!”

*1:52 Gimli suggest going through Moria…*  
 Of all the changes made by JB&amp;W this one confuses me the most. Moria was a huge Dwarven city, Balin decided to retake Moria over thirty years before the Fellowship set out, and he has been presumed dead for decades. There has been no word from Moria, but Gimli seems to think it’s viable and operating. “My cousin Balin would give us a royal welcome.”

Gimli being ignorant of Moria’s status while both Gandalf and Aragorn fear that it is a death trap is a really bizarre story choice. It makes no sense logically, and it doesn’t make any sense structurally. I can’t figure out why they thought this was “better” in any way. Even Saruman (Sauron’s proxy as a villain all through this trilogy) seems to know there’s a Balrog waiting in Moria.

*1:55 Saruman can do anything…*  
 Saruman seems to have no limits in this film. He uses the crows as spies. He controls the weather. He causes a landslide in the pass of Caradhras. He calls lightning from hundreds of leagues away… it’s just too much. This isn’t how magic works in Tolkien’s world, but we’re not in Middle-Earth, we’re in a mediocre D&amp;D adventure where the bad guy knows *everything*. Then Gandalf defers to Frodo, who has no idea what the options are or what they mean. 

*2:02 Gandalf can’t open the doors…*  
 Doddering old Gandalf can’t even come up with the answer. Frodo, the sudden riddle-master (it isn’t a riddle at all, but whatever) has to figure this out? Why did they even bring Gandalf? Once they get in to what is obviously an unlit, disused, long-abandoned entrance, Gimli, who is plainly delusional, says, “Soon, Mr. Elf, you will enjoy the fabled hospitality of the Dwarves. Roaring fires! Malt beer! Red meat off the bone!” It makes NO SENSE.

Imagine having to go through the remains of Fukushima to get somewhere. You know there was an accident, and people went in thirty years ago to do cleanup but there has been zero communication. Why, upon reaching the desolate, abandoned outskirts, would you announce how great it will be?

*2:13 Pippin knocks every piece of metal in Moria down the well…*  
 No scene better illustrates what’s wrong with Jackson’s change in tone than this one. In the book, Pippin, fascinated with the well, drops a pebble down it. After a long fall, there’s a quiet *plunk*, followed long minutes later by the sound of far away drums. It’s an incredibly real moment. A young, impulsive character indulges what seems like a harmless but irresistible whim.

In Jackson’s Bigger, Dumber, Louder, Improved version, Pippin feels an arrow in a body, the head in armor falls off followed by the entire body, a huge iron chain, a ’55 Buick Roadmaster and anything else that could be comically, absurdly loud. At that point, OF COURSE there are drums because it’s a MOVIE MOMENT.

*2:21 Cave-Trolls and Spider-Orcs…*  
 Again, Frodo gets to cower. In the book, he stands side-by-side with Boromir, cries “For the Shire!” and stabs the troll’s foot with Sting, which wounds the troll. Here he runs, cowers, whimpers, makes one lame slash and is hammered by the troll in such a way that, even if the spear didn’t penetrate the Mithril, his innards would be jelly.

Next they run for the bridge and the orcs pour up from the floor and… out of the ceiling? Hundreds of orcs can suddenly defy gravity, crawling like spiders down the pillars, a super-power they have never had before in any version of the stories, and one they never display again. All for a stupid visual.

*2:26 Gandalf holds the bridge against the Balrog…*  
 This sequence makes me angry because it works **so well**, and the reason it works is because it is almost verbatim from the goddamned book! It is proof that, had J,B&amp;M just *trusted* the source material, they would have had a film with so much more depth, power and meaning.

*2:42 The Mirror of Galadriel…*  
 This was when I knew the problems were bigger than I imagined. The removal of Sam, and his vision of Bagshot Row being torn up, was the harbinger of Jackson having removed the Scouring of The Shire. They also fucked up Galadriel’s dialogue for no rational reason; “Things that are yet to come to pass” is a helluva lot less elegant than “Things that yet may be.”

*2:59 Aragorn forgets what movie he is in…*  
 When JB&amp;W threw out the plot point about an eventual choice of whether to go to Mordor, Minas Tirith, or split the Fellowship and take different paths, they apparently didn’t care that they also threw out Boromir’s reason for joining. Had Boromir been told (as he was in this film) that the Fellowship was *never* going to Minas Tirith, he would have ridden home like a good solider to advise Denethor. Instead, he tags along hoping to… what? Wheedle the Ring away from Frodo? Was Boromir instantly ensnared at the Council of the Stupid?

After his confrontation moments earlier in which Aragorn announces he would not bring the Ring within 100 miles of Minas Tirith, that should have been the last straw. Boromir either needs to take it and go, or simply go. But follow he does. When they stop at Parth Galen, *everyone* should have abandoned Aragorn when he forgets what world he’s in and says, “Orcs patrol the eastern shore. We must wait for cover of darkness.”

So… The chief of the Rangers, who has been fighting orcs for 60 years and understands that they are almost completely nocturnal; bred in darkness, hunting and fighting in darkness; and even though there are “new” orcs that move and fight in daylight, they are still *orcs*… this Ranger decides to *wait for the cover of nightfall?!?*

Of course, this is because the writers removed their reason for stopping. There is now no course to be chosen, but they still need Frodo to encounter Boromir alone in the woods. In this version, this valiant band of intrepid heroes simply fail to notice both Frodo and Boromir sneaking away. Apparently, Boromir is the only member of the party with eyes, ears and a brain. 

This moment makes everyone else an idiot. Frodo is an idiot for going off on his own. Sam is an idiot for losing track of Frodo. Aragorn and Legolas are *literally* on the lookout for threats but miss a full-size man in chain mail sneaking away. And Merry, Pippin and Gimli are just idiots most times, full stop.

*3:01 Boromir has Frodo in his grasp…*  
 The Ring makes you invisible, not intangible. Boromir has both hands gripping Frodo’s vest, and yet Frodo puts on the Ring and Boromir somehow… loses his grip? Uhmazing!

*3:03 Frodo gets permission to leave…*  
 This moment. **This fucker right here.** This, more than anything else, displays the actual contempt Jackson, Boyens &amp; Walsh have for Tolkien’s work and his characters. In the book, of course, Frodo realizes the Ring will twist the mind of *anyone* near it and so he must go alone. He makes this decision and goes off, saving only that Sam refuses to be left.

But Jackson’s Frodo is just baggage. He has no agency, gets to make no decisions. He merely bounces and runs from event to event. And Aragorn must be *Our Hero!* He cannot doubt, he cannot be uncertain. Frodo tells him he must go alone and Aragorn consents. He ***CONSENTS???*** 

Aragorn agrees to send Frodo off alone, followed by Gollum, with no map, no guide, and no idea of where he is going. Aragorn thinks this is a ***GOOD IDEA?!?*** 

Never, under any circumstances, would anyone who understood or cared about these characters write this scene. Aragorn’s flaw is his arrogance. He might send everyone else off to Minas Tirith, but he would *never* abandon the Hobbits, confident that her could resist the Ring. (And perhaps he could; he never seemed tempted on the long march to Rivendell, or at any point between there and the Argonath)

**Choose** to send them off **alone?** Go. Fuck. Yourself.

But Jackson’s Aragorn isn’t a person; he’s a Hero. An archetype. He cannot be so easily fooled or have choices taken away from him. He *must* be in command of the non-humans *at all times*. 

This choice by the writers breaks so much of what comes after it can never be fully recovered. The breaking of the Fellowship was supposed to be a chaotic moment of panic followed by an agonizing choice of what to do next. It is the moment when Aragorn truly becomes a leader because he is forced to make a hard choice. Prior to this, he has had Gandalf and Galadriel and the river Anduin to guide him. Under his leadership, everything goes wrong, and that is important. It makes deciphering Frodo’s tracks and choosing to pursue Merry and Pippin *matter*. 

That is too much complexity for Jackson’s Aragorn. No hard choices for him. “Yes, Frodo, you go. I have a huge, overblown action scene to insert myself in! After that, I know *exactly* what to do!”

This is when I actually felt hate for this film. It is unforgivable.

*3:05 Aragorn is INVINCIBLE!*  
 OMG this stupid, stupid fight scene. It’s bad enough that 60+ orcs in full armor (yes, I counted, and that’s just in that shot; seems closer to 100) were able to sneak up on Aragorn in the woods. Then he wades into them and hold his own. Sixty. Uruks. Who, apparently, only have bows when they face Boromir.

And the orcs come within a rat’s ass of catching Frodo; they see him, they chase him; but valiant Merry and Pippin distract the orcs and Frodo the baggage runs away again. Meanwhile, Merry and Pippin stand like the idiots they are while an orc, ordered to bring them in alive, comes at them with an axe and HEEEEERE’S BOROMIR!

Finally Lurtz the super-orc *remembers he has a bow (not that he knows how to draw it)!* And it fires arrows the size of fence posts! Because *of course* it does. All to add a ten-minute-long action sequence that isn’t even in the damned book. 

*3:15 Sam rejoins the movie…*  
 And now, here’s Sam, running back to the boats from wherever the hell he went for the last 12 minutes that he didn’t find a single member of the company or a single orc. In the book, of course, he actually reasons out what Frodo is doing (the only one who does), but that’s far too smart for this hapless version of Sam Gamgee.

All kidding aside, now Jackson has to manufacture a moment of emotion for Frodo leaving. He builds it out of yet one more push in on the Ring in Frodo’s hand followed by voice-over of Frodo and a flashback of Gandalf, and it’s a castle of pure cheese. This would have all happened organically if they had just shot the ending of the book.

This ending also makes Frodo a complete dick. In the book, he is sneaking away with the Ring on, and Sam finds a boat letting itself out into the river. He runs in after and Frodo hopes Sam will give up and go back. This version of the “making the dog leave for its own good” scene is just embarrassing, and because it’s an argument, it makes Frodo seem incredibly callous.

Then Sam drowns. For an hour. 

*3:18 And the rest is loud and stupid…*  
 It’s comedy after this. They send Boromir off in the boat without the weapons of his enemies. Aragorn loots the body, taking Boromir’s bracers for his own, ‘cuz that’s a thing you do to your friends and not out of character at all. Then, they all just watch Sam and Frodo go because this is Aragorn’s *decision*, remember.  

• • •

In the end, the problem is Peter Jackson, Philippa Boyens and Fran Walsh didn’t use the characters from the books. They used the uncomplicated, YA novel versions of them. Generic Old Wizard. Generic Fantasy Hero. Generic Dwarf. Generic Elf. And four Hobbits whom they seem to have forgotten were adults. It’s as if they treated the Hobbits like children because they are the size of children. One might think the men of Rohan wrote this script. 

If you’ve made it this far and think this is out of control, I’ll share that there were around 60 comments I didn’t make, or deleted. And that’s setting aside my issues with the technical filmmaking, which are many. 

Peter Jackson felt he could tell a *better* story than Tolkien. To my eye, all he did was tell a loud, simplistic, stupid version of a similar story.

Their argument was that Tolkien was not consistent with his spellings throughout the years and that the original spelling is not the same as it is today. Sort of a similar situation to how the Bible is a translation of a translation of a translation, so the meanings aren't always the same.

Multiple google searches of the origins of the name and differences between editions/printings brought up no results. They seemed confident in their argument (although they came off a bit tense) and I'm personally not knowledgeable enough to know about all the minute differences of each edition of the series. I felt bad not giving them the point since I went with what was on the card. The game even has a wiki for fans to submit corrections and that card wasn't listed as incorrect.

I've always been curious about Gandalf's (or any wizard's) abilities. Thinking back to the movies, every ""magic"" thing I can remember him doing seems to involve one of two things: 

* Talking to animals (Shadowfax, the Eagles, the butterfly that summons the Eagles)

* Creating light with his staff (holding off the Balrog, pushing back the Nazgul, scaring the orcs at Helm's Deep). He also pushed Sarumon out of Theoden's head, which may or may not have been using the staff in the same way, I'm not sure

His other feats, that I can remember, were all related to being really old/wise/respected, not magic.

He can't seem to communicate over a distance or teleport or anything like that, since he always rides a horse when he's in a rush. When fighting in Minas Tirith, he doesn't use any magic, he just fights (awesomely) with his staff as a melee weapon.

I remember Saruman threw a fireball once, but I don't think Gandalf ever did anything like that.

I'm just curious if the White Wizard's magical abilities mostly involve communicating with nature and having a staff that can emit ""good"" or ""holy"" light, or if there's more to it? Maybe he has other powers, but he holds them back in order to allow men/hobbits to reach their full potential, or something like that?",What are Gandalf's powers/abilities?

lotr,"After many hours spent reading and researching all of Tolkien's works, I have finally finished this project which I started over 2 years ago now. In a previous post I linked a spreadsheet containing all population and military size estimates for the 3rd Age. In a series of upcoming posts, I will be explaining my reasoning for each of the numbers starting with the Dwarves:




Blue Mountains: 10,500

 - My first thought when I started with the Blue Mountains Dwarves was that there was no real way of estimating the number of Dwarves that lived there. The only pieces of information that I had to work with were that many Dwarves moved out of the Blue Mountains to Erebor once it had been reclaimed, and that there were 3 of the 7 Dwarf Divisions inhabiting them (before the migration). I started by calculating the army that Dain would've possessed during the Battle of the 5 Armies. Dain brought 500-600 Dwarves to the battle, but likely left a large portion of his army back at home since it was a rushed call to action. He likely ended up only taking about 1/3 of his total military force. Assuming this, he would have 1,500 semi-professional soldiers at his command. Since Dwarves are a much more warlike than the other races of Middle Earth, it is safe to assume that this would make up around 1/8th - 1/9th of the total population of the Iron Hills at the time (this is also based on lower populations usually having larger percentages of their citizens in the fighting force). This would give the Iron Hills a population of 12,500 Longbeards. We can assume that this is roughly half of the Longbeard population, while the other half lived in the Blue Mountains. On top of this, there were the Firebeards and Broadbeams, though they no-doubt have smaller populations than the Longbeards since they had been nearly wiped out previously, as well as the Longbeards being the most predominant of the Dwarf races (likely about 1/5 - 1/4 the total Longbeard population for each race). This would mean that before the migration, the population of the Blue Mountains would've been roughly 18-20,000. With this in mind, we can assume around 1/2 of the total Blue Mountains population left for Erebor once it had been won back. This would leave the population with 10,000, and likely 10,500 by the War of the Ring (dwarves populate slowly, especially in the 3rd Age).

Erebor: 17,500

 - This one, with the above calculations already complete, is much easier to estimate. Assuming that 8-10,000 dwarves migrated from the Blue Mountains to Erebor, as well as a large portion of Dain's people from the Iron Hills (likely about 3/4ths of the 12,500 mentioned above), I estimate there were roughly 17,500 - 20,000 Dwarves residing in Erebor during the War of the Ring.

Iron Hills: 3,500

 - This was also very easy to estimate base on the above calculations. Since there were roughly 12,500 Dwarves living there during the Battle of the 5 Armies, and 3/4ths of them left for Dain's new kingdom in Erebor, we can make an estimation that there were 3,500 dwarves left behind to dwell in the Iron Hills during the War of the Ring (though they were likely called to Erebor to assist Dain in fighting the Easterlings).

Red Mountains: 31,500

 - Obviously, this number could be VERY inaccurate - in-fact, it's possible that there were no Dwarves living in the Red Mountains - but this is my best guess. It is largely accepted that the other 4 Dwarf divisions dwelled in the Red Mountains. Those being the Ironfists, Stiffbeards, Blacklocks, and Stonefoots. My estimation is that each of those races had less than half (for the purpose of the calculation, we'll assume 1/3rd) the population of the Longbeards (which, based on all my calculations above is around 20-25,000). 1/3*4 = 4/3,   4/3*22,500 = 30,000 Dwarves at the time of the Battle of the 5 Armies, and around 31,500 by the War of the Ring. Again, this is completely a guess since we have no real information about these Dwarves.

Other Dwarves: 2,500 - 15,000

 - There were likely other smaller groups of dwarves roaming/living in other mountains scattered across Middle Earth. I have no calculations to back this one up.





Let me know which of these numbers you would change and why. As these figures are not definitive, I am open to changing my numbers if it is for a valid reason.

lotr,"So, I'll start this off by admitting this probably doesn't have a simple answer, and since Tolkien did change his mind on things, from time to time, it might not even just have one, but...

Were the Orcs still Children of Eru? Did He abandon them?

They may, or may not, have once been Elves, twisted by the Dark Powers, but we are led to believe that they weren't made, as they were, by Eru Illuvatar; they were forged of something else by Melkor, who lacked the power to create on his own; only being able to twist what his father had already cast. It wasn't a simple process; fast or kind, and though I guess they could have simply resisted, till the end, and died, being swept back to Eru Illuvatar, at least some of those Morgoth took became Orcs, became loyal to him, and became evil. As they are, few others would show them love, or expect anything of the like from the orcs, in turn, but one might argue that, unlike the Numenorians, who were more simply corrupted of thought by Sauron, and punished for their transgression, the original would-become Orcs may have had no choice, being twisted beneath powers they had no hope of resisting.

And this will get me to Numenor, for a moment. I ALWAYS complain about the fate of Numenor; how an otherwise distant Illuvatar, who didn't step in, and intervene no matter the level of monstrosity was being loosed upon Arda, did his one Sodom and Gamorrah Old Testament moment, and obliterated the island of Numenor, and most of its inhabitants, after having Ar Pharazon, and his Great Armament swallowed up by the lands of Aman, for daring to sail into the Undying Lands. I always complain because it seemed an inflated sentence. He could have still lifted the Undying Lands, made the earth round, and left the Numenorian fleet sailing in circles, until starvation made them return home empty, but He didn't. Part of why this is, in my limited understanding, is that the Valar were forbidden to harm the Children or Eru; Manwe, Aule, Tulkas, and the others couldn't stop the Great Armament from reaching Valinor, and they had to instead beseech Illuvatar to intervene on their behalf, and so He did.

Well, what of the Orcs? Could the Valar harm them, in their many battles of the First Age? I won't bemoan that the Elves, the Dwarves, and the Men fought them; killed them. Had they not, the Orcs would have killed in turn, and they were rather monstrous, by this point, but it gets me back around to the question; were they still Eru's children, whatever their form, or simply fit for conflict, and destruction? Was there some truly twisted thing that Melkor, with his original level of power, as the greatest of the Valar, could do to them that changed them so much Eru would turn His gae away from them, and no longer see them as ""fit for purpose""? When they died, do we believe their souls still travel to Mandos, or were they so broken that they just poofed out of existence? Could they still live forever, if violence didn't find them, or were they rendered ""mortal"" by the machinations of Morgoth? Had He wanted to, and not used up His one intervention on Numenor, could Eru have ""saved"" the Orcs, or were they always intended as such, since none can act save in the will of Eru, and those who struggle to most will simply find they were given His most important parts to play?","Were the Orcs Still ""Children of Eru Illuvatar""?",1672527833

I’m doing my yearly X-max to NY’s rewatch of all all 6 extended editions, and I’m in the middle of An Unexpected Journey.

When Thorin looks at Gandalf and says, “where are you leading us?”

Gandalf just glares at him and says nothing.

All i can think is, “Dude, you involved yourself in something that Gandalf set it motion.  By hook or by crook, the greatest Maiar ever to exist accomplishes his goal, no matter what it takes, and won’t prevent you from exercising your Eru given free will for a single moment.  What did you think was going to happen?”


Also, random note:  In the wake of Morgoth’s fall, Sauron was captured by his Eönwë and commanded to return to Valanar for judgement, as Maiar are explicitly forbidding from passing judgement on other Maiar.

So, Gandalf the White, having been returned from death by Eru itself, passes judgment on Saruman, breaking his staff with a word, casting him from the order, and leaving him a mortal (with only the power of his voice left to him).

So, does that mean that Gandalf is no longer a Maiar?  Is he now a Valar?  Is he something in between?

lotr,"I lost my grandpa this year. He was like a second dad to me. And he often did feel more like my dad than my actual father at times when our relationship was strained when I was young (don't worry, me and my dad are closer than ever now). 

If I had to describe him physically, and not just saying he was one of the kindest and gentlest people you could meet: he was tall (6 foot something, taller than my dad), had a big bushy beard as long as I knew him, a very deep voice and he was a lover of nature. I always loved going on walks through the woods with him when I was little (and we came across a bear one time!). Now, who does this sound like? 

For me, it's Treebeard. My grandpa's voice wasn't as deep as his obviously, but all the above attributes, and the fact that he also had a cadence in how he spoke like Treebeard, made me immediately think of him when he came onscreen. And upon this realization is when I started to cry. So much that my roommate heard me and checked on me thinking I was having a breakdown, and I was.

I'm a filmmaker and I'm starting to think people have a misunderstanding of how to make a successful movie or show, especially in the fantasy genre. 

Fantasy media is a genre that almost requires an expensive budget to make the unbelievable believable. Only animation can achieve a lower budget. That being said you need your movie to be watched by as many people as possible to make your money back. 

I also believe following word-for-word source material is a surefire way to have a box office flop but a great fan score. Not want you want when your budget is hundreds of millions. These movies/shows aren't made for super fans that know the lore, they are made for as many people as possible to enjoy.  

Not sure about this subreddit, but I know there's a huge push against this so-called woke agenda in the media. The introduction of black characters and powerful women seems to rub people the wrong way (among other lore problems). What people don't understand is that it works, that's why Hollywood is doing it. Because that is what the mass audience wants to see, they just don't want an agenda behind it, just let it be. Meaning, let a black character be black, we don't need a monologue about racism in a story where that doesn't exist. House of Dragons did this very well. 

Just curious, do you guys believe an adaptation should be followed word for word despite losing money, or liberties are inevitable so that as many people as possible can enjoy?","In defense of ""The Rings Of Power""",1672437614

Tolkien says that the biggest problem with Lord of the Rings is it’s short length. I’m curious if he ever wrote of any additions he would have made to the text had he another chance to write the book. Personally, I feel like he would have developed the Fellowship a bit more maybe giving them another adventure or two, padded up Frodo and Sam’s story in Two Towers befor they reach the Black Gate, expanded on the lore surrounding Sauron and explain more about Mordor’s workings, maybe add some information about Haran, drawn out the Scouring of the Shire, and give a longer ending to the already long ending.

I am not. I was talking to a friend, and he mentioned there were flaws, and I said “Yes, but not that many,” and he told me that the biggest one is that there are no women. He felt ashamed when he read an article told him there were no women, and he had loved the book so much, he had never realized that it never featured female characters. I’ve never been bothered by this. I’m a woman. I still grew up with a mind loving fantasies. I still enjoy Tolkien without him adding ladies to every story. Perhaps some would get bored with all the bearded dwarves and such, but I read it like it’s a historical account. It just flows of the page, and I’ll read any fantasy or historical fiction novel with that much ease in writing. I don’t know. I find it realistic that a bunch of dwarves, a wizard, and a hobbit would probably not run into a lot of women while venturing off to the Misty Mountains for long ‘ere forgotten gold.

However, in like the second chapter Gandalf also remarks that the ring did not intend to be picked up by hobbits, and that it must be the work of some other force. 

Having read a decent portion of the first book, I’m coming to understand that the world of Middle earth is insanely complex and there is so much shit at play.

lotr,"Something I notice when people talk about lord of the rings films is how the movies skip the fact Gandalf was away for 17 years and by the time Frodo left the shire he was 50, while I get it’s not that big of a deal (and let be honest it wasn’t that important) but let’s consider a few things that could lead to the 17 year time skip

1. Frodo not aging, we already saw this with gollum and Bilbo as both of them got extended lives due to the ring and Bilbo looking around 75 despite being 111, it’s not hard to say the same happened with Frodo and even if it wasn’t life extending magic there’s 50 year olds who still don’t look old, sure there’s Sam, Merry and Pippin who are younger but apart from pippin they would have been in their 20s

2. Barad Dur still being under construction, we see in the film that after Frodo gets the ring, the tower is both still being constructed but also only as far as the hill top, and when they’re at Bree and the forests the tower is completed, but then again these could just be future visions like when Gandalf tried to pick the ring up

Overall it is confusing on whether or not a 17 year time skip did occur or not in the films but in my personal opinion it’s likely a skip did occur but not as long, but overall too I think that the 17 years was not that important to the plot, I get alot of the confusion also is due to Thranduin telling Legolas to find Aragon despite Aragon being like 10 years old but let’s be honest if you take the Hobbit films seriously that was your first mistake",Theory: the 17 year time skip still occurs in the film,1672252011

The problem is I just can’t get over some of the writing and details that I think make the show so much worse than it could’ve been.

1.) at one point Adar says summon the legions. A legion should be… one legion is 4,000-6,000 men…and by him saying legions it should’ve been a massive army of orcs. Instead it’s a couple of hundred and they get owned by the lame ass human village.

2.) does numenor not have an army? They make it look like it’s a bunch of ordinary citizens going to protect the queen. Also, they’re all training in the town square like it’s a little show. And to make matters worse….they only use 3 ships? 

3. The Mordor PowerPoint, I mean…cmon lol 

4.) the whole halbrandt thing. Did he mean to be in the middle of the ocean? Or is it just luck? Regardless, stupid way of introducing Sauron.

I have one of the Harper Collins editions, so there's Bereliand in the back, but I'm really curious if there's official or unofficial/fan works of how the land changed from when the Valar started building Arda/throughout the battles with Melkor, and until we get to the Arda and Middle Earth we see in the Third Age.

lotr,"What I don‘t understand in Tolkiens work is the concept of evil and the responsibilities evil acts have on the person who executes it. 
Let me explain: IIRC when Morgoth longed for the silmaril he started to manilpulate the Noldor. His dark whispers created the concept of evil inside the hearts of the elves. Greed, hubris and selfish pride where emotions/ thoughts the elves didn‘t know before. Am I right? Morgoth brought evil to Arda and everything he touched got infested with it. 
I know his whispers fell on fertile ground with the Noldor, but only his interference caused the distrust for the Valar and the following desaster. So the kinslaying was a direct consequence of Morgoth‘ actions.

The kinslaying was cruel, yes, but was it right for the Valat to punish the Noldor that hard? Wouldn‘t it be wiser to forgive and show them right way? Especially when the Valar should be wise enough to know that the Elves wouldn‘t stand a chance against Morgoth on the long run? 
I find it odd for them to say „Nope. You don‘t fit our society of white heroes anymore. Go f urselves and see how you will handle YOUR consequences!“ when all of this was caused by one of their kind. I don‘t get it. It feels wrong. Especially if you look onto the suffering that the Noldor got back thousandfold afterwards. The children of Illuvatar did not know evil until Morgoth told them. The Valar were their to guide elves and men.

I‘d really like to hear your approaches on this topic.",Evil and forgiveness,1673560799

Maybe it's that nostalgia that makes me a little biased, but I feel like the soundtrack genuinely captured the essence of Middle-Earth, especially the Shire and One Ring themes.

When I found an audiobook that plays samples of the music score in the background, I felt greatly more immersed in Tolkien's world, especially the scenes in Baggend.

I find the Shire's music to be both relaxing and comforting, but at times it proposes a spirit of wonder at times. Perhaps even a bit adventurous. The inclusion of the violin makes old timey and rustic while the flute gives it the feeling of people who are closer to nature. It overall feels simple, but still promises fullness. If that makes sense.

Then I feel the One Ring's theme creates vibes of something old and until recently lost. It feels charming yet oddly sinister. Ask if the darkness behind it is more subtle than anything else.

One aspect of Gandalf's character that I find particularly interesting is his decision to spare Saruman at the end of The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Many readers may see this as a weakness in Gandalf's character, but I believe that it is a crucial part of his development.

Gandalf is not a vengeful or cruel character. Throughout the trilogy, he is shown to be a wise and compassionate leader, and his decision to spare Saruman reflects this. Gandalf understands that Saruman is no longer the powerful wizard he once was, and that he is now a broken and bitter old man. Instead of punishing him, Gandalf chooses to have mercy on him and allow him to live out the rest of his days in peace.

Furthermore, Gandalf's decision to spare Saruman also shows his commitment to the greater good. He recognizes that it is more important to focus on the defeat of Sauron and the restoration of peace in Middle-earth, rather than seeking revenge on a fallen enemy.

In conclusion, Gandalf's decision to spare Saruman is not a weakness, but rather a demonstration of his wisdom, compassion and his commitment to the greater good. By sparing Saruman, Gandalf is showing his wisdom in understanding that Saruman is no longer a threat, his compassion in not wanting to punish a broken man and his commitment to the greater good in focusing on the defeat of Sauron and the restoration of peace in Middle-earth.",Why Gandalf's decision to spare Saruman is a crucial part of his character development,1673406197

Titan was dead. The pieces of land were moving around the sky, there was no green to be seen nor any living thing that walked or flew in the air. The seas, rivers and lakes seemed like they boiled. 
Only because they did not listen to him. 

*We could have ended this. If you weren't all so stubborn, we could have ended this. All would live, children would finally taste bread and the sky would be clear. But you destroyed it. All of you!*

That was it. He tried to fight back then. No longer now. It is over.

""I am done."" he said, looking over the wasteland. ""Maybe death will be kinder.""

""I am not so certain. Death is too final, is it not?""

He jumped. 
""Who is that?""

""Patience, my friend."" Thanos froze. The voice tha spoke to him was ancient, wise...and melodic and beautiful. ""Rashness is what cost your kind life, did it not?""

The person who stood before him resembled a Terran. But only slightly. They were tall and majestic to look at. Long white hair and a the ageless face made them seem like a god of Terran myths. A specimen of physical perfection. But most impressive (and terrible) thing Thanos noticed were the eyes: eyes of flame and ash, yet holding wisdom beyond time and space itself. And why they? Thanos could not guess what this was: male or female. But it looked androgynous, as if, as if...

*As if body is just a garment they wear, not important to them.*

Thanos fell to his knees.

The Stranger smiled. ""Oh...we have had a bit of a problem, have we not?""

Tha voice tone sounded like that of a male. He, then.
""Who...who are you?"" was all he could ask. ""Are you...a god?""

Thanos never believed in them. Not until now.

The Stranger passed by him, touching him on his bald head. ""It could be put that way. I was here before all things. Before Asgardians, before your masters and before even the Cosmos itself."" he smiled again. ""*All* of Cosmos.""

Thanos narrowed his eyes. ""You...you knew this would happen?"" he straightened up and clenched his fist. ""You let this happen?""

""Pardon, Thanos. Do not be so angry, my friend. What could have I done?"" he shrugged. ""Nothing but observe. You were right: your plan of random elimination would have saved the planet, but they did not listen to you. If they did, they would be alive right now.""

He sat upon a rock. His fair appearance and...cleanness made everything around him seem pathetic, weak, filthy and ruined. As if a dead world already wasn't those things. Even the way he was keeping his right hand behind or in his robe made him look more...divine.

Thanos grunted when he realized what the Stranger said. *He knows my name.* ""No. They didn't listen to me.""

""And what you predicted came to pass."" The Stranger reached out with his hand and, in little sparks, a cup filled with a red liquid was formed. Thanos backed away again, glancing at it, expecting a poison.

""Do not be disturbed, Thanos."" he drank from one side of the cup. ""It is a drink from Earth, my friend. You would like it.""

Reluctantly, he took it and drank a bit of it. The taste was sweet, but odd. ""Are you from Earth?"" 

The Stranger waved in a dismissive gesture. He did it with such boredom, as if everything around him was ashes compared to him. ""That little world is like as an ant is to you. Sure, they are ants who can talk, so they sometimes get my attention because of that, but otherwise, no. It could not mean less to me.""

""Xandar?""

""Now, they are rats that might be useful at something, but still no.""

""Then who are you?"" Thanos asked.

""Ah."" he almost scoffed, but from his mouth it sounded elegant. ""A good question. I have always wondered how to explain when some of you ask me. In an as accurate way as possible, without your mind being unable to understand it.""

Thanos groaned. ""I don't like riddles!""

""Ah, good!"" the Stranger waved again. ""They cost me much a thing at one point. But, let us not talk about me, Thanos: how about you? What will you do now?""
Thanos eased his temper and looked around, seeing he chaos, ruin and death that was around him. He stood up, sighing. ""Die."" he said. ""I will stay and die here.""

""Oh, please."" he said. ""As I have told you: death is so...final. Why not use the time and resources you have for something else?""

""Resources?"" he looked back at his guest, with gnashes teeth. ""My home is gone.""

""You still have established property in other systems. You do not have nothing.""

""My home and people are gone!"" he mouthed, turning away. He had cousins all around the universe actually: Eternals. Thena was the closest one and he even had a brother, Eros. But his people who raised him and his home from childhood: they were gone. ""I have nothing else to live for.""

""Untrue."" the Stranger repeated and crossed his legs. ""For example, you could make sure nothing like this ever happens.""

Thanos turned. ""How?""

""Quite simply, actually."" he said and smiled. ""Just do it with your own hand: eliminate half of life in the universe and all peoples will live to see another day.""
He stared at him for a time. He said it as if he was talking about changing garments and then going to the toilet to release oneself. 

""You're insane."" he said honestly. ""There is no such power anywhere in the universe.""

""No!"" the Stranger stood up and smiled again. ""Incorrect! Again. It is possible: definitively so. In fact, as easy as drinking water. You just need a couple of things to fulfill the task and make it mean something.""

""Yes. I totally believe you."" he himself almost smiled, though he did not find it funny at all. ""Please, enlighten me: what is it?""

""The Infinity Stones."" 

Thanos froze at the mention that. The story as old as time: Infinity Stones, that came to be at the very beginning of the universe, representing its aspects. It was said even one stone would give an individual incredible power. Countless people looked for them, fewer obtained them: it is said in stories that even Celestials, the masters and constructors of Thanos' ancestors, looked for them and desired them. 

*There are six of them, he thought, Space, Time, Mind, Reality, Power and Soul.*

""Myths."" he sighed. ""Lies of ancient people. They never existed.""

""Really?"" the Stranger walked slowly and gracefully, not making even a small sound. ""Then why"" he reached out with his right hand. ""am I holding one in my hand?""

The Titan backed away. In the Stranger's hand was a small, beautiful stone, shinning with the light of yellow star. He felt it speak to him. Calling him. Thanos had no words. He just stared at it, then at the Stranger.

""You,"" the Stranger smiled. ""already understand that this might be the only way to do it: if you eliminate half of all life, the other half will thrive and live in prosperity. You thought of that yourself, did you not?""
They called him a madman, but he knew it was true: for life to survive at all, one half needs to die. And I was right, even just on my planet.

""It is a pity what happened to your world. It was beautiful. But there are other worlds out there, with children born, living and dying in hunger. Those worlds are just as beautiful as yours was. Would you want others to die too?""

He thought about it. Power to save everyone, by myself. He could not protect his own, but he could protect others. He looked at the stone, uncertain what he admired more: its beauty or the power it will bring. 

Then he remembered who held it.

""How?"" he pointed at him, accusing him. ""Who are you? Your name: now!""

The Stranger shrugged again. ""I told you: someone who wants to help you.""

""I might be desperate, but I am not a fool."" he hissed. ""What do you want?""

""You are insulting me, Thanos!"" he laid his hand upon his chest in protest. ""My desire is nothing more than for you to succeed. You see, our objectives are merged with one another.""

He tilted his head. ""Our objectives?""

""Yes. Yours, mine...and my master's, of course."" 
He blinked. This creature, standing in front of him, looking like a god in mortal world, had a master he served. ""Your master?""

""Indeed."" he smiled. ""Surprised? Oh, well, you see Thanos, the most impressive and gifted creatures recognize the greatness of those above them. My master, you see, is the Great Lord: Lord of Highest Places and the Master of Fates. A great power that belongs to **him** is rightfully **his** and the Great Throne is **his** dwelling place. I, on the other hand..."" he shrugged. ""You can think of me as **his** High Priest.""

""And what does your...lord want?"" Thanos asked with despise in his voice. He always hated religious fanatics. *This one is not a god, but surely presents himself as one.*

The Stranger looked at the moon closest to Titan. Even it was red as blood.
""We have enemies: my master and I. You might have heard of them and, if you have not, you will, under right, or, should I say, wrong circumstances. They call themselves the TVA."" his face twisted in disgust. ""A group of fools who think too highly of themselves and who stand as annoying insects at your neck.""

""What is their crime?""

""They are keeping some of my colleagues back. But more importantly, they are keeping my master at bay.""

Thanos chuckled. ""Who'd you call him: Lord of Highest Places? Right... If he is so powerful, how come he is held by that group?""

""A group can hold a great beast in chains. Does that mean they are greater than the beast?""

Thanos' smile disappeared. ""No.""

""Indeed. I would even say one only fears that which is greater than him. Nevertheless, in this they succeeded: others are out there and my master cannot take physical form in the Cosmos. Only I am able to step into reality and only I am able to touch it. So master chose me as *his* voice and *his* eye in the Cosmos.""

Thanos looked back at the Stone, his eyes basking in its glory.

""And this,"" the Stranger grinned. ""is how you will help me. Go and find them: the Infinity Stones. They are the very weapons keeping my master chained outside of the Cosmos or, as some of you would call it, the Multiverse. Do with them what you will: bring balance, bring peace, bring bread and breath to the entire universe and you will be its Saviour!"" he raised his finger to point out. ""There is one condition, only one thing you will need to do to return the favor to me: when you are done with your mission, you will destroy the Stones.""

Thanos' jaw dropped. ""What?""

""You heard me well: destroy them. All of them. Reduce them to dust and ash. That will be enough to accomplish my master's desires.""

The Stranger's gaze cut Thanos deeper and was pulling him more than any word that he has spoken, or anyone ever, for that matter. The fiery eyes burned: burned for real. They daunted him and made him feel like a rat. He only had strength to make one response.

""Will it work?"" he asked. ""Do they have the power to do it? Will I be able to do it?""

""Absolutely!"" the Stranger said, almost laughing.  ""Once you have the Stones, it will be quick and easy. All you will have to do is this!"" he snapped his fingers. ""And half of all life will end, just as you intended. The only condition I give you is to destroy them. That is all we ask of you.""

""I don't care for power."" Thanos said. ""I will not care for Stones after they served their purpose.""

""Perfect. Then it will not be hard of you to destroy them."" 

Thanos glared at the Stone again. He could feel its power, its strength, its energy touching his mind and sending thoughts as if they were words. He could save the entire universe. He would not be a madman like they called him. *They would call me a Saviour.*

He took it.

""There, you see!"" the Stranger clasped with his hands. ""Then it is all arranged! We shall both get what we wanted.""

""You still didn't give me your name.""

The Stranger raised his right hand. Only now Thanos noticed it was missing one, index finger.

""I have had a fair share of them, but..."" he smiled. Smiled like a devil.

lotr,"Not necessarily which film is the best in either its theatrical or extended form (we all know that’s Fellowship of the Ring heh) but which film do you think is most improved by the additions of the extended scenes?

As much as I love the extended edition of Fellowship of the Ring, the theatrical cut of that film is also a god tier, 10/10 film that’s pretty much perfect. The extended cut hues a bit closer to the book and has a looser structure and more measured pace that recalls the writing of Tolkien, but since the film is a masterpiece in either form I’m not sure it greatly improves the theatrical cut.

Similarly, I consider Return of the King to be the most hit and miss of the three films in both the theatrical and extended cut. I think the extended cut does ultimately improve the film, we get Saruman’s resolution (even if the scene isn’t great the character deserved closure), some really great scenes like the houses of healing, Aragorn mastering the palantir (basically the conclusion of his character’s arc) a great scene with Frodo and Sam at the crossroads of the fallen king, as well as some great scenes in Mordor fleshing out their journey. And while I know many debate Aragorn beheading the mouth of Sauron you can’t deny it makes his line “For Frodo” that much more impactful. The additional paths of the dead scenes are kind of dumb, but I won’t throw out the baby with the bathwater. 

But ya know, I think Two Towers is the film that most improves with the extended edition. If I had a big knock against the theatrical cut of that film it’s that Jackson spent so much time focusing on Aragorn, Rohan, and the Battle of Helm’s Deep, he ended up relegating the hobbits to supporting roles. The extended edition fills out both Merry and Pippin as well as Frodo and Sam’s subplots very nicely, while also fleshing out our boy Faramir is some ways that greatly improve his character and storyline.

Overall, my vote goes to The Two Towers.",Which LOTR film is most improved by its extended edition?,1673392776

lotr,"-Sorry for bad translation- Fra to Eng.

I was 9 or 10 years old, it was in 2005 or 2006, I don't know exactly...

At that time, after school and during certain weekends, my friends and I used to go to a large park, near ruins, to play ""knights"", as they said.

No adults to watch us, no cell phones, no buildings, no roads, the immersion in our heroic marvelous universe was perfect.

There were about ten of us, boys and girls.  We had a lot of fun, I remember that the hours passed very quickly, too quickly.

In truth, we liked to mix all the universes that we liked at that time.

We had a lot of fun!  There were epic battles, knights equipped with wooden swords, magicians' staffs improvised with tree branches.

For the girls... Rather the princesses... The most miserable knights among us were transformed into magic horses, harnessed by jump ropes.

It was our universe, a mix of Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, our favorite cartoons and legends.

Me, I was a black magician, I was the bad guy.  My father, who is very handy, had made a magnificent magician's stick for me in a cherry branch during our holidays in Auvergne, enough to make all my friends jealous when I returned.

During a school trip, my older brother, meanwhile, had brought back a replica of the One Ring from Italy.

It wasn't mine but, although I wasn't allowed to use it, I really liked taking it on the sly to go and play in the park with my friends.

With this artifact in my possession, you can imagine that I was the most interesting.

Despite our young age, we liked to play in a very role-playing way, so I had become the most powerful, the strongest.

My friends were then particularly attracted by the precious.

And to avoid any effects of covetousness and envy by my comrades, I had crimped the One Ring at the end of my magician's staff.

So he was and would only be mine.

The battles were terrible, my magic was terrifying, growing, and the enemies bent under my power.

Until the day I stuck my stick in a cardboard shield.

In the heart of this park which was the scene of our confrontations, the ring had fallen.

It was only at the end of the battle, much too late, that I realized it...

Itt was then real tears that sprang from my body.

No more playing, it was no longer fun for anyone.

The cries of a child, who loses the object of the desire of all his comrades.

I had lost the Ring from Lord of the Rings!

Thus my friends helped me to search throughout the park, for hours, over several days, without ever finding the precious one.

That day, was it stolen from me?  I will never know.

A few years later, I returned to the park to remember the scenes of our heroic exploits, our merciless struggles, the countless losses, and the incessant marriages between knights and princesses, but also and above all to seek one last time the  'Ring.

I never found it, maybe it's still there?

Did someone, a child maybe, or worse an adult, find it before me?

They stole it from us.

He was mine. He is ours...

This has left me with the dvd choice of Blu-Ray or 4K to choose from, however, I don’t really know which one to choose, because I’ve heard there is good and bad aspects to both versions. I know that the Blu-Ray Extended version of Fellowship has the blue-green tint to it, that makes it wildly inconsistent with the Theatrical version, which would be a pain to dodge around in my editing process, but I also know that 4K has smoothed out a lot of the definition of certain shots, specifically LOTR. Though it seems to fix the tint issues for Fellowship, I’ve also noticed the 4K versions have made some other interesting color changes, such as making Smaug’s gold abrasively yellow. 

Ultimately I would like to hear everyone’s opinions on which version they prefer in order to help me make my decision. I did notice there was the Ultimate Collector’s Edition of the films, that had both Blu-Ray and 4K, which would solve my conundrum, but marked down, it’s still about $200.

lotr,"When Gandalf calls Pippin a “fool of a took” many may have realized he just insulted Pippins entire family. But it goes deeper if you analyze the language a bit more. He is saying in less words the following ‘you are the biggest fool amongst an entire family of fools’. And yes in the books he did have that sentiment. But it goes deeper if you go back to the hobbit when Gandalf was looking for the 14th member he was looking for a hobbit that may have a bit of the old Took in him. The Took’s were known for being more adventurous (foolish in the eyes of other habits), kinder and more inquisitive. While the Baggins family was more stead fast, polite and learned. Bilbo was very well read mind you. Gandalf had a love hate real with the took household. He admired their willingness to go off on random adventures and the fact that Pippin was the most likely probably was a bit too much. Also if you take a closer look into Gandalfs action,  Pippin was the only one to receive harsh words from directly from Gandalf aimed directly at him. Yes he calls Denethor a madman but he says it to Pippin. Now if you believe this is because Gandalf hated Pippin and merely tolerated him. Or if you feel that Gandalf consoling Pipping numerous times in battle of Pelennor Fields shows that Gandalf was just frustrated his inquisitiveness and recklessness. Remember there is way more behind that “fool of a took” line.

Recently I rewatched all the extended editions of the Peter Jackson movies and I don’t know which one is my favorite now. Before rewatching them I would’ve said that fellowship was my favorite but now I’m not sure. Each film is so excellent and does things that the other 2 don’t do. Fellowship is so good at getting you sucked into the world and learning the characters and there’s a ton of emotion too. Two Towers continues the momentum and emotion that part 1 left off on in such a great way, and the journey with the characters is so good and satisfying to watch that it rivals the first film. Return of the King knocks it out of the park with concluding the story; showing where all the characters end up and how the story ends up in a very melancholy way.

lotr,"Tldr; Which order should I re-read all the books for the 2nd time. 1st time was Hobbit, LOTR, Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales.

Alright my fellow lotr friends. I am very close to barking upon my second ever re-read of Tolkein's works, and I am having a bit of a problem deciding which order to do things in.

First, allow me to say that as a young man, I loved the PJ film adaptation, and I am saving my rewatch of the trilogy for AFTER this re-read. I thoroughly enjoyed the movies and some PS2 or PS3 game I played back in the day, always wanted to read the books. As I grew older, I delved more deeply into the lore of various fantasy worlds (Star Wars, Star Trek, The Witcher, The Last of Us, Horizon Zero Dawn etc..) but I was always saving the best for last.

I knew that consuming Tolkein would be an adventure on it's own, but the more I delved into little YouTube videos about why the Hawks didn't fly The Fellowship to Mordor, or why Gimli was so devastated in Moria, I started remembering all the questions I've heard, with answers I didn't fully understand over the years.

-Why did Gandalf survive the fight with the Balrog?
-Why does the ring slip off fingers?
-Do Elves live forever?
-Who is Sauron?
-Who built all these ruins you see throughout the movies?


Whenever I heard the answer to these questions, it left me with MORE questions. What is a Maiar? What do you mean the Eagles aren't just Eagles? 

I am delighted to tell you that I have, slowly but surely, attained the answers to my life-long questions through both YouTube videos, and good old fashioned Tolkein at his finest.

I began my journey with The Hobbit, after learning about Tolkein's life experiences, I found it fascinating reading through this book with my new knowledge.

Continued with the Lord of The Ring. WOW! What an amazing set of books, I can't even begin - and won't bother to bore you - with describing the beauty of the world, and the talent which Tolkein so lovingly wrote this amazing piece of masterful literature. Finally gave me my proper introduction to the story how it SHOULD be told.

I bravely followed this up with The Silmarillion. I was always intimidated by this series of stories the most. However with a little bit of YouTube summaries to help hash out the finer details, I would like to think I had a pretty good understanding of what happens in the three ages, from an overall perspective. I may not be quite to the level where I can always name names and events or places correctly, but I understand the Creation myth, I understand the First and Second age events overall and the Third Age just kinda flew by. I found The Silmarillion to be very well written (notnthat it means anything coming from me) and although st times a tad taxing, I did find the varied and intertwined stories to be compelling.

Now I am nearly 2/3 of the way through The Unfinished Tales. Tying up the loose ends I have always wanted to know about. I loved the tale of Turin, I feel I am getting substantially better at reading Tolkein and understanding his flow at this point. I am cherishing the last bit of Tolkein's tales before I have finished.

Now, the re-read order I am considering is beginning with  The Silmarillion, The Hobbit, LOTR and any Unfinished Tales I want to hear again.

Should I go in this order? Or should I cut right to the juice and go straight back in to the whimsical nature of The Hobbit I've been missing these past 30 years of my life.

I’ve been thinking about just going ahead and starting Shadow of War next, but I haven’t really collected all of the artifacts or completed all of the weapon quests. I was wondering if there was really anything else to fully gain from them outside of a sense of completion?

Also as a side question, what’s the general consensus of this game and its story? I’m not very big in the lotr fanbase and have only a bit of knowledge on the lore so I don’t know if this game is considered a black sheep or considered amazing by the fan base. Personally enjoyed the game a decent bit and thought the nemesis system as a whole was a cool concept. Plus commanding Uruks and the different beasts was really fun.

One thing I'm curious about, I don't recall from the books, and I haven't found an answer searching this forum, but this particular name I mention above.

I understand the implications of what ""Stormcrow"" represents and I believe Grima also makes the same implication in the movies.  Was Gandalf referred this way in Rohan and in Edoras in the years prior to him arriving in Edoras with the members of the Fellowship (absent Samwise and Frodo) or is this only a title thrust on him by Théoden while under the influence of Saruman?

When riding into Rohan, as Gimli says ""you'd find more cheer in a graveyard"" but I'm not sure if this is a product of the displeasure of seeing Gandalf come to town, a product of the current scenario in Rohan, or both?

Additionally, when counseling Théoden, at least in the film, the king gives a tepid glance at Gandalf as Gandalf counsels him.

lotr,"Since it's Tolkien's birthday:  There are Tolkien fans in the sword and sorcery community. But that bunch (which I'm a junior member of), doesn't look to epic/high fantasy the way most Tolkien fans do.

But Anglachel has always stood out to me as having a very sword and sorcery feel. Much more than the rest of The Legendarium. This is from [a rather long essay I wrote](https://www.blackgate.com/2018/04/02/tolkiens-magic-sword-anglachel-2/) on Anglachel:

TURIN SPOILER AHEAD (Though you should know Turin's tale if you're reading this)

 'While magic swords are common in the modern fantasy/RPG world, they  were rare and prized in Middle Earth. Anglachel could cut through iron  and it glowed with a pale fire, which truly marked it as a wondrous  blade. It was also sentient, though that is not revealed until the end  of its tale. Horrified to discover that Niniel was really his sister,  Turin addressed the sword:

&gt;“Hail Gurthang! No lord or loyalty dost thou know, save  the hand that wieldeth thee. From no blood wilt thou shrink. Wilt thou  therefore take Túrin Turambar, wilt thou slay me swiftly?’ “

And from the blade rang a cold voice in answer:

&gt;“Yea, I will drink thy blood gladly, that so I may forget  the blood of Beleg my master, and the blood of Brandir slain unjustly. I  will slay thee swiftly.”

By mentioning Brandir’s unearned death and speaking of loyalty to  Beleg, Gurthang’s words indicate that it wasn’t animated by the essence  of Eol. The sword wants to allow Turin to right his wrongs by letting  him kill himself. This is quite different from the dark malevolence of  Elric’s Stormbringer, which delights in stealing the souls of the albino  prince’s friends. Stormbringer is revealed to be a demon, and it speaks  to Elric at the end of the epic saga, “I was a thousand times more evil  than thou!”

However, if we dismiss Eol’s dark character as the source of  Anglachel’s intelligence, there is no other indication of where the  sword drew its abilities from. We could infer it was a combination of  Eol’s craftsmanship and the meteorite iron, but that’s just pure  guesswork.'

&amp;#x200B;

lotr,"  Sigh. What is there to say about *The Two Towers* other than “What a fucking mess.” 

At least with *Fellowship*, you can pick apart the elements that Jackson, Boyens &amp; Walsh “improved” and explain why they feel so disrespectful to the books. There are also moments (a few) that genuinely *feel* like Tolkien.

This film is mostly just 8 hours of stupid crammed into a 4-hour bag. It’s impossible to truly analyze what’s wrong with this film because so little is right. In that regard, I’ll just stick with the broadest of strokes.

People in this forum often challenge me as to why I dislike the PJ films so much, so, by request, here’s a breakdown of what I find so offensive about the Extended Edition of *The Two Towers…*

*•* *•* *•*

*:03 Gandalf &amp; The Balrog fall for an hour…*  
 Okay, I promised not to nitpick but I kinda can’t resist. I know Gandalf said, “Long time I fell, and he fell with me,” but there’s a difference between “A long time” and “Holy shit, still falling.” Gandalf and the Balrog fall for 71 seconds. For the record, that’s a fall of over 15 miles. I *think* that’s probably excessive.

*:04 Sam &amp; Frodo…*  
 I will admit, now that PJ&amp;W are forced to treat them as main characters, Frodo and Sam are suddenly a lot closer to their book personalities. Without all the Important Characters to look after them, PJ has no choice but treat Sam &amp; Frodo like adults. Sam is capable, and Frodo is no longer a cringing coward, paralyzed by fear, and it’s refreshing. For this first bit, before JB&amp;W start “fixing” the plot, this actually feels like *Lord of the Rings*.

*:14* *Sméagol promises nothing…*  
 An incredibly important moment JB&amp;W either didn’t understand or didn’t care about. Sméagol has to **speak his promise to the Ring**. That’s how the magic, the control, the prophecy of it works. 

“Sméagol will swear never, never, to let Him have it. Never! Sméagol will save it,” and “I will serve the master of the Precious!”

Sméagol **must** say these things (or something close to them) to build for himself the clever trap that forces his own doom. The Ring compels the completion of both of these oaths. In the film all he says is “I will serve the master…” but that’s nothing.

*:18 Orc noses and Aragorn’s intuition…*  
 Not only can orcs climb down walls once per movie, they can also scent men an entire day’s run away (once per trilogy, because they never smell anyone who might surprise or overtake them again). And then Aragorn *instantly* knows the orcs have scented them! 

*:20 “And the union of the Two Towers…”*  
 STOP putting the fucking title into dialogue, Jackson, you hack! It is completely stupid and unnecessary. Of course this is followed by the most absurdly arch order to burn Fangorn that Christopher Lee could possibly contrive. *This thing will be your undoing; let’s say it out loud to make sure everyone knows you’re destroying all the trees!*

*:22 Burn this pointless village! We need an action scene!*  
 It really is so dumb. Yes, Saruman was able to raise the wild hillmen and the Dunlendings, but we didn’t need to waste the screen time watching this village being attacked.

It is also a really ham-fisted way to introduce characters to show Éomer finding Théodred (who was supposed to have been 41, BTW, not this pretty boy) just to take him home to die. We shouldn’t be meeting these characters until our leads meet these characters. It’s just crappy storytelling.

*:25 The Grima &amp; Théoden Show…*  
 There’s a part of me that really thinks Jackson was playing these characters as comic relief. Both Théoden and Wormtongue are presented in such ridiculous, over-the-top, comic-opera extremes he cannot possibly have wanted this to taken seriously. Here’s Théoden from the book:

“Upon it sat a man so bent with age that he seemed almost a dwarf; but his white hair was long and thick and fell in great braids from beneath a thin golden circlet set upon his brow. In the centre upon his forehead shone a single white diamond. His beard was laid like snow upon his knees; but his eyes still burned with a bright light, glinting as he gazed at the strangers.”

Compare that to the old man who cannot even open his eyes and speaks only to Wormtongue in unintelligible mumbles. Again, JB&amp;W have proven they have literally zero subtelty. Every element must be heightened to the point of utmost stupidity. The Rohirrim are a proud, warrior people. Is it plausible that they would still follow a doddering old man who could neither stand nor speak? Everything about this version of Théoden and Wormtongue is ludicrous.

Then, when Éomer steals Gandalf’s thunder about Grima’s price, Jackson ACTUALLY HAS WORMTONGUE LOOK AT ÉOWYN! Is this a student film? 

Next, guards come to beat the crap out of Éomer. Who are these guys? Are they being paid by Wormtongue? They certainly wouldn’t act like this simply on his say. Again, for this rotten kingdom ploy to work, Théoden has to be the puppet, not a slobbering pile of suet.

*:31 The Riders of Rohan attack in the dumbest possible way…*  
 Guess the orc’s noses don’t work at night because they failed to smell horsemen and horses. I recognize there wasn’t the screen time for the Riders to harry and surround the orc band as they do in the book, but having them display even rudimentary knowledge of tactics for attacking from horse would have been nice. Instead, they just blunder in. At night when the orcs have the advantage of visibility. And use bows at close range with their own guys running around. But, yeah, what did I expect?

*:40 Treebeard kills Grishnak…*  
 I *really* hate this introduction of Treebeard. Not because it isn’t what happens in the book, but because it’s completely out of character. It is an incredibly *hasty* act, and gives the wrong impression of how Ents behave (or how Ents *should* behave) right out of the gate. Immediately, he involves himself in the affairs of the other races.

Yes, Treebeard hates orcs, but in the book he suspects Merry and Pippin of being orcs and waits to decide. This version of Treebeard doesn’t even jibe with the one we see later at the Entmoot who is so passive he has to be tricked into attacking Saruman.

*:42 The Dead Marshes…*  
 The Marshes the way it was written in the book is so much more cinematic than what ended up onscreen, it’s bizarre that Jackson changed it. In the original, the initial entry takes place after dusk, and the lights (which are referenced in the film but never seen; maybe an effect never got finished?) are all around. The faces are much more dimly visible and hypnotic. Then the wraith flies over and the lights go out. It’s a *great* visual. 

Instead, JB&amp;M had to have their second zombie moment, and instead of being glamoured, Frodo falls in and is assaulted by shrieking undead faces and it’s all shtick we’ve seen a hundred times. PJ did it better in *The Frighteners*.

Immediately after this, Frodo lies there masturbating the Ring. Because even the draw of the Ring had to be loud and stupid. Instead of fighting until almost the end, we’re literal screen *hours* away from Mt. Doom and Frodo has already lost the battle. IT’S TOO FUCKING MUCH, PETE!

*1:05 The Elven cloaks are from Harry Potter…*  
 Of *course* Sam falls off a cliff near the Black Gate and of *course* two Easterlings come to investigate. Frodo wraps them in his Elven cloak and the observant Easterling stops three literal inches from the hem of the cloak and yet, in broad daylight, cannot see them. It is so over-the-top dumb I was expecting Frodo to have grown a lightning bolt-shaped scar when he finally opened the cloak (which has become a much larger molded stone covering).

*1:10 Merry &amp; Pippin are still idiots, and Old Man Willow is in the wrong film…*  
 Why do Merry &amp; Pippin have to have a scrambling pratfall argument about Merry drinking the Ent draught. Can’t Merry just… drink the fucking water…? Do we have to *witness* them growing, complete with gassy sound effects? 

And then here’s Old Man Willow, fresh from The Old Forest, just in time to make it seem like Treebeard isn’t even in charge of the trees *in his own Enthouse*, much less the rest of the forest. Because heaven forfend we go more than 4 minutes without a forced, unmotivated action sequence.

*1:19 The scuffle before Théoden’s throne…*  
 It’s been five minutes. Time for ACTION! Instead of allowing Gandalf to command the room, as he does in the book, the men of Théoden’s house rush in for a quick fistfight with Aragorn and the boys while Gandalf *actually casts the spell* to release Théoden. The subtle elegance of the book, *did Gandalf use magic or just psychology to get Théoden out of his chair?* We can’t have that. 

No, in Jackson’s world, Gandalf has to actually say “I release you from this spell!” But that’s not enough! No, he has to light the room with his white cloak, and apply electro-shock with his staff, jolting Théoden in his chair Once! Twice! Thrice! Complete with sound effects and a cutaway to Saruman flying across the room!

It is. So. Dumb.

In this world, Théoden is a barbarian king and wants to kill Wormtongue, depriving him of the delicious guile he displays in offering Wormtongue mercy by offering to let him ride into battle. Then, Jackson sets up Aragorn to immediately undermine Théoden’s renewed authority by stopping him from exercising his vengeance. The only person in this scene with motivations that make sense is Wormtongue.

*1:30 Helm’s Deep is a stupid idea…*  
 Nothing that happens in Jackson’s film after Gandalf Abracadabras Théoden makes sense. In the book, he counsels Rohan to make war against Saruman so the threat of Isengard will not be on the flanks of Gondor. They ride out, hoping to reach the Ford of Isen before the defense there has faltered, but they are too late. Word reaches them of the rout, and they fall back to Helm’s Deep at Gandalf’s urging.

In the movie, they spend a long time burying Théodred (whom the audience never knew, and there was no narrative gain to having alive at all), after which Théoden refuses to ride to war, and instead heads directly for Helm’s Deep (with *all* his people), which Gandalf thinks is a terrible idea. This is just pointless meddling with the story to add needless conflict between Gandalf &amp; co. and Théoden, and it makes the plot pointless. 

Apparently, in this movie, there are no keeps in Dunharrow? Why would Théoden then not simply head for Minas Tirith? Wormtongue makes a point of telling Saurman the road to Helm’s Deep is dangerous and slow. No one has any clear motivations at this point; it’s just a bunch of word salad designed to get to a huge battle, which is Jackson’s only goal for this film.

*1:35 Aragorn absolutely leads Éowyn on pointlessly…*  
 In the book, Aragorn is incredibly careful not to flirt with Éowyn. He recognizes that she wants him, and he gently, but firmly, shuts her down. It’s noble and honest. A bit cold-hearted, but he is part Elven (well, in the book; Viggo has a beard so Jackson’s Aragorn is plainly 100% human, but whatever). 

Here, Jackson has Aragorn flirting with absolute intent, just to say later, “oh, sorry dummy, my heart is taken.” It’s a shitty bro-move, and unworthy of the character.

*1:45 The Hobbits are idiots again…*  
 Sam &amp; Frodo’s brief time of being capable adults is all done, because now there are Important Humans about. While in the book, they realize Faramir’s men are near and hide, leaping out to make an impossible stand and thus impressing Faramir and his men, PJ has them bumbling into Faramir, falling on their asses and begging for mercy. No bold bravery here, just pathetic little people.

*1:55 PJ Sends in THE WARG RIDERS!*  
 What is there really to say about this stupid, pointless warg rider attack? Obviously, JB&amp;W felt they had gone too long without an Action Sequence! so we get this. It does nothing to forward the story, depletes Théoden’s forces to a comically small number, and inserts the so, so absurd “Aragorn is dead! He fell off a cliff!” beat. Everything about this is wrong.

The whole sequence ends with Wormtongue saying “But my lord, there is no such force!” only to be shown Saruman’s army arrayed below, so there must be some secret hidden entrance into Isengard because somehow Wormtongue didn’t pass or see these “tens of thousands” of orcs on the way in.

*2:10 Elrond prophesies Arwen’s ending…*  
 I actually really appreciate them including Arwen’s miserable end from the Appendices; a lot of people never read them, and fail to understand how few happy endings there are in Tolkien’s world. Most roads lead to sorrow. My only complaint is that it is so cheesily done, with Hugo Weaving chewing all the scenery and spitting it right into the camera. With even the slightest touch of subtelty, this moment woulda been beautiful.

Then, of course, it all goes to shit with Galadriel’s telepathic infodump (to Elrond, I guess?) for those who haven’t been following along. 

And, of course, Anborn knows Théoden has taken his people to Helm’s Deep even though there’s literally no way they could know this. Also, apparently, Osgiliath *just fell*; in his flashback, Denethor tells Faramir “but for you, this city would still be standing.” 

Weird because Osgiliath was ruined 500 years earlier, and looks it, and Faramir doesn’t seem quite that old. Gondor had retaken both banks about 20 years earlier, but then lost the east bank a year before the movie. Not sure what this memory is of them reclaiming Osgiliath. Just an opportunity for Denethor to be a dick.

*2:30 Faramir is just another thug…*  
 Tell me again how Peter Jackson does not have complete contempt for Tolkien’s characters? Faramir is *different* from Boromir. That is the entire point. That is why Denethor despises him. Faramir has studied with Gandalf, has a mind for history and strategy, and Faramir is not arrogant. But Jackson can’t abide subtlety or shades of grey, or the Faramir, who encounters the ring and turns it away, saying “Not if I found it on the highway would I take it.”

*This* Faramir lets his guards kick the shit out of Gollum. This Faramir is shifty and untrustworthy. This Faramir declares the Ring will go to his father, even *knowing* Denethor would become a tyrant if given it. Because in Peter Jackson’s universe, the Ring would already have won and Frodo been killed for it because *all* men are *instantly* susceptible.

Following this, Aragorn finally rejoins the movie already in progress, having taken a pointless little holiday in the river Isen.

*2:45 The Fucking Goddamned Elven Archers…*  
 No. No, Peter. You do not get to ignore *everything* about Tolkien’s lore and go unscathed. The elves Do. Not. Fight. This. Fight. For all the reasons you ignored, and everyone else already knows. The elves are leaving the fighting to men. Period. Fuck you and Fran and Philippa for deciding to include them. Absolutely no. The Last Alliance was the LAST. You DO NOT get to make a NEW one.

Worse, they are from “Elrond of Rivendell,” but they’re archers of Lorien, so it doesn’t make any logical sense either.

SO much is so dumb about this battle sequence. Relegating Gimli to comic relief status by putting him on the battlement, where he would never be in the first place. How easily the wall is overrun. The orcs being so much stronger than men as opposed to relying on strength in numbers. The orc running with the Olympic flame. The breach in the wall being replaced by a huge explosion (with Aragorn on top of it, naturally). Gimli jumping directly onto a field of upraised spears and missing all of them. The archers charging, instead of, y’know, shooting arrows. The Dwarf tossing. The ridiculous giant siege ladders going up fully loaded.

The goddamned shield. How did any of you ever forgive Legolas and the goddamned shield?

*2:58 The Ents decide not to go to war…*  
 I’m guessing primarily because they decided yes in the book. And, of course, because no one gets to be heroic but the heroes, so we have to set it up that Pippin *directly* leads the Ents to war.

*3:11 Faramir drags Frodo to Osgiliath…*  
 Just the cherry on top of making Faramir a myopic dickhole in this version. He sends the Hobbits off to Denethor, which means he *was* resisting the power of the Ring. He didn’t try to take it for himself. He is *choosing* to send it to someone he knows will do terrible things with it. But, yeah, JB&amp;W didn’t make any important changes to the characters at all…

*3:16 Gandalf returns with Éomer…*  
 So, the Elven archers (all of whom seem to have died by this point) were able to get here on foot from Lorien *before* Gandalf and the remainder of the Riddermark were able to arrive? Given that, in Jackson’s version, Gandalf brings these guys rather than the Huorns, this really seems like far too little, far too late. Especially since *none* of these horses would survive the charge down that hill.

Also, are both Éomer and Gandalf stupid enough to just charge into an entire wall of set pikes? Seriously, this is cavalry 101. Do Not Ride Into Pikes. Yeah, the sun comes up right behind the charge, but the pikes are still set. It’s SO DUMB.

*3:20 Frodo shows the Goddamned Ring to the Goddamned Nazgûl…*  
 If this isn’t proof that Jackson does not understand the story he is supposed to be telling, I don’t know what is. Right here, the movie is over (again). Frodo (now magically atop a tower) shows the Ring to one of the Nine. Sam saves Frodo, Frodo flips out and threatens Sam with Sting, Faramir shoots the fell beast with an arrow, and the Nazgûl **FLIES AWAY?!?**

None of that matters. Sauron now *KNOWS*, not suspects, not fears, but *KNOWS* the Ring is in Osgiliath, being carried by a Hobbit. The rest of the Nine would *instantly* descend on Osgiliath and tear it apart until the Hobbits were found. Even if that somehow failed to happen, it means ~~Gandalf’s~~  Aragorn’s feint at the Black Gates wouldn’t work. Sauron would know the Ring wasn’t with them. This moment completely and irretrievably breaks anything that comes after.

Then, in what I’m certain is a middle finger to people like me, Sam cries, “It’s all wrong! We shouldn’t even be here.”

That’s right, Sam. It is. And you shouldn’t.",Why I Hate the Films: Part II; The Two Towers (Extended),1672643830
lotr,"People in this forum often ask why I dislike the PJ trilogy so much. They assume it’s because things got cut; I get lectured about how you can’t translate an epic like LotR word-for-word, and I understand that. I’m a filmmaker. I never expected we would have Bombadil, or every moment of the trilogy represented.

What I didn’t expect was Jackson’s absolute disdain for the actual soul of the trilogy itself. When I watch these films, I see a lot of great work; the art department, costume department and makeup department obviously wanted to make *Lord of the Rings*, and, largely, they did a fantastic job. 

The script, however, displays obvious contempt for the characters and the world in which they live. At one point, in the Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens audio commentary for *Two Towers,* Boyens says, “Look, our version is just better!”

It's plain that was their attitude about the entire story, and it makes me sad. It makes me angry. Peter Jackson had all the tools at his disposal to do it right, and he pissed it away. No one in my lifetime will have this opportunity again.

I’m not interested in changing anyone’s mind, and you can save your “But dude, Legolas shield-surfing the stairs is AWESOME and I heard the book ends on a total downer!” comments as well. Downvote away. I’m not gonna stop saying the films are terrible, and I honestly don’t care about your arguments to the contrary. This just gives me an easy way to answer *why*. 

I have a lot of issues with the actual filmmaking choices Jackson made; photography, lighting, editing; but that isn’t what this is about. This is about *story*. Frankly, there are a million elements I could tear apart (i.e. *Dayum it’s bright as day in the caverns under the Misty Mountains… no wonder Bilbo found the Ring*), but I’m trying not to be too picky and focus solely on the things that really make me gnash my teeth. By request, here’s a breakdown of what I find so offensive about the Extended Edition of *Fellowship of the Ring…*

*•* *•* *•*

*:03 Elrond in the front lines…*  
 Why is Elrond literally the only warrior in the Last Alliance who couldn’t afford a helmet? This makes me crazy. It’s a little thing but it’s a good indicator of the kind of senseless cheats the next 12 hours are gonna be full of.

*:17 Gandalf prat-falls around Bag End…*  
 Right out of the gate, Jackson begins undermining Gandalf. These aren’t Tolkien’s characters, they are two-dimensional Fantasy Film Archetypes straight from Central Casting. Gandalf has to be a doddering old man because that’s what old men do; they walk into chandeliers and whack their heads on low door frames. Gandalf isn’t a demigod, he’s your absent-minded old uncle. That grinding sound is Tolkien spinning.

*:19 Bilbo hasn’t told Frodo his plan to leave…*  
 The choice for Bilbo to have not revealed his plan to Frodo is very odd. It makes Frodo seem gullible, and it also seems like Bilbo doesn’t trust Frodo, having not taken him into his confidence. It’s just extra story baggage that isn’t really true to the characters.

*:26 Gandalf is surprised by Bilbo’s party trick…*  
 Poor Gandalf. Even though he knows Bilbo better than probably anyone, even though he has plenty of time to see what Bilbo is doing, he is somehow caught unawares by Bilbo putting on the ring. In the book, of course, he adds a flash and bang to make it seem like a trick to mask Bilbo’s vanishing. But poor old movie Gandalf just isn’t that sharp so he sits there like a dunce.

*:27 “What about this ring of yours, is that staying too?”*  
 In the book, it is plain Gandalf approves of the party and the spectacle to make it easier for Bilbo to part with the Ring. That’s the entire plan. For some inexplicable reason, in Jackson’s universe, this is the first time the subject has come up?! So now, in the minute before Bilbo leaves, Gandalf has to browbeat him into parting with the Ring? Why? What narrative purpose does this *possibly* serve other than making Gandalf infinitely less wise than he is in the books? In this version, why wouldn’t Bilbo react as if Gandalf was trying to defraud him?

*:31* *Gandalf almost picks up the Ring…*  
 Had Jackson left the Ring on the floor to be encountered by Frodo when he walked in, it would actually have been a nice, relatively subtle indicator that Gandalf was afraid to touch it. Instead, we get this little waking nightmare with the flash on The Eye. At this point, in Jackson’s world, Gandalf should have no doubt, or, at the very least, much stronger suspicions that this is The One. At this point, it is cruel, criminal and negligent for Gandalf to allow Frodo to take it. But this is doddering Granddad Gandalf, so, of course he just backs away in fear and says “Keep it safe little dude.”

*:37 Gandalf is terrified and scares Frodo to death…*  
 I understand the drive to make the narrative more urgent by drastically condensing the length of time Gandalf is gone from The Shire, and the time Frodo has to plan, but having him return, losing his shit and literally jumping at shadows is just incredibly out of character. 

It also makes it completely irrational for Gandalf to then go off again. If he’s that afraid, he would never leave Frodo and the Ring. He even departs in the same direction as Sam and Frodo, and just abandons them in the forest instead of taking them with him to Rivendell and going from there to see Saruman. In condensing the timeline, Jackson, Boyens and Walsh have completely thrown out the logic.

*:48 Gandalf trusts Saruman…*  
 Oh simple, trusting, doddering Gandalf. In the book, Gandalf *never* trusts Saruman. He only goes to him at Saurman’s request, and even then, gives him no information. In the film, of course, Gandalf lays everything out like a simpleton. Then Saurman REVEALS TO GANDALF THAT HE HAS A PALANTÍR?!? Why would he ever do this? It is an instant admission of guilt and betrayal.

Then we have this stupid, *stupid* wizard battle. Ninety interminable seconds of Old Man WWF that ends with the most ridiculous spun-by-wires scene ever. This is the polar opposite of how magic works in Tolkien’s world. I am embarrassed for this film.

*:53 Frodo finally officially meets Merry &amp; Pippin…*  
 This is a huge thing that most people who love the films simply gloss over, but it changes the tone and tenor of everything that comes after. Before this, we have seen Merry &amp; Pippin precisely twice; once, being idiots stealing a firework to set it off themselves at the party, and again dancing on a table at The Ivy Bush.

Now we meet them stealing vegetables from Farmer Maggot, and Pippin says, “Merry! It’s Frodo Baggins!”

I don’t know why this change made sense to JB&amp;W, but in this version *Merry &amp; Pippin barely know Frodo*. They are, at best, casual, small-town acquaintances. They are absolutely *not* his best and oldest friends. Then, suddenly, they’re all just… together. But there is *absolutely no reason Merry &amp; Pippin would have gone with Frodo*. Yes, they’re mischievous young Hobbits interested in adventure, but this is actual pants-pissing danger. Absent the relationship that’s established in the book, nothing that follows between the four of them makes any sense at all. 

*:57 The Black Rider actually catches them in the forest…*  
 These Black Riders are so much more aggressive and unafraid of anything than they are in the books. One of them has already cut down the gate guard at the Brandywine Bridge in a quick shot. In the book, they are reticent to declare open war on The Shire and the Downlands. They avoid Maggot’s dogs; they attack the Prancing Pony by stealth. These Black Riders would just kill everyone and sift the bodies.

Setting that aside, at this moment, the movie is over. They are actually caught, in the open, by a Rider. Frodo manages to escape, at 3 ½ feet tall, running from a horse. The Rider doesn’t cut them down, doesn’t grab Frodo and pull him over his saddle. He just flails around. This moment is aggressively stupid.

*1:02 Frodo puts on the Ring at the Prancing Pony…*  
 As far as we know, this is the first time Frodo has ever put on the Ring, and instantly, he’s in nightmareland and Sauron INSTANTLY sees him. In the book, the real world fades a bit and hearing is sharpened; had this happened every time Bilbo put on the Ring, obviously, he wouldn’t have used it.

*1:03 Aragorn and Narsil…*  
 Now we’re getting to the point where JB&amp;W have fucked up the opening of the story so much that things are beginning to unravel, and will require a lot of pointless patchwork later on. Aragorn draws a sword here, but it isn’t Narsil. But why would it be? There’s no letter from Gandalf, and Butterbur barely knows him, so there’s no reference to the sword that was broken to give Aragorn his bonafides. 

Frodo simply… takes him at his word, which makes Frodo really dumb. In fact, in this version of the story, there’s no way Aragorn could have known to be looking out for the Hobbits in the first place. Gandalf abandoned them and rode hell-for-leather to Saruman, so who told Aragorn they were coming?

*1:04 The Riders assault on Bree…*  
 And in another Jackson “enhancement,” the Riders literally ride down an entire section of wall, crushing Old Harry underneath. Ahhh, subtlety. But after declaring themselves in this way, they don’t ransack the rest of the inn? They just… leave…?

*1:10 Saruman takes orders from Sauron…*  
 Here we see Saruman getting direct marching orders from Sauron. So we lose all the complexity of Saruman being a competing power and instead he’s simply a minion of Sauron. Makes everything that follows much more two-dimensional, and it’s unfair to Saruman whose arrogance assured him he was in control at all times. Clunky, clumsy, simple-minded.

*1:11 Aragorn hands out blades…*  
 Aragorn hands out four Hobbit-sized blades he just happened to be carrying. So not only did he magically know the Hobbits were coming, he magically knew *how many*, even though there’s no reason in the world Merry &amp; Pippin are still following.

*1:14 Aragorn fucks off and leaves the Hobbits to die…*  
 Everything that could be wrong with this scene is wrong. Aragorn goes to “have a look around,” and can’t be bothered to come back until everything is fucked. They are *supposed* to have a fire. Aragorn builds it in the dell at the top where it won’t be seen from below. The entire space in the film is much too small. 

The description in the books is artful; figures of dread and terror.

“Over the lip of the little dell, on the side away from the hill, they felt, rather than saw, a shadow rise, one shadow or more than one. They strained their eyes, and the shadows seemed to grow. Soon there could be no doubt: three or four tall black figures were standing there on the slope, looking down on them. So black were they that they seemed like black holes in the deep shade behind them. Frodo thought that he heard a faint hiss as of venomous breath and felt a thin piercing chill. Then the shapes slowly advanced.”

In the film four (then five) brightly-lit guys in black cloaks advance to so close to the cowering Hobbits it’s comical. Then, because every non-human in Jackson’s film must be Less Than Aragorn, Frodo just lies back terrified. He doesn’t call out the name of Elbereth (he doesn’t even know any lore, apparently), he doesn’t stab the Witch King, he doesn’t do anything but piss himself. Then, finally, Aragon appears in slow-motion with his generic sword and a torch (lit from what fire? Also, not a brand, and actual *torch*), *sets fire to two of them and actually fences with the others until they fucking flee because he’s just* ***that*** *badass*. Then the INCREDIBLY STUPID torch-throw that ignites the fifth Rider which then flees as well. 

This scene is just so *wrong*, so utterly and completely **not** from Tolkien’s books it would be comical if it wasn’t so painful.

*1:18 Shit-covered Lurtz and the Uruk-Hai*…  
 Yes, the Uruks had been bred to be bigger and less light-sensitive than regular orcs, but this is just absolutely ridiculous. They still only survive by strength in numbers, and trying to make a “super-orc” secondary villain is a cheeseball move.

*1:19 Arwen…*  
 Jesus, this… I get it. There aren’t a lot of women in LotR, and here’s Glorfindel just kinda hanging around not doing anything, so why not replace him? But this meet-cute moment with the sword in the forest, and Aragorn just chewing up the Athelas and mashing it into Frodo’s wound, it’s all so ham-handed. It’s like you told the story to an 8-year-old and then asked him to tell it back to you.

And, of course, because Frodo is just baggage in this movie, he cannot ride alone. He has to ride with Arwen so she can have this “Come and claim him!” moment. But we lose Frodo refusing the summons of the Riders, one of the most important moments of Frodo’s stoicism before reaching Rivendell. Instead, he’s just afraid and useless. 

Then Arwen calls the flood rather than Elrond releasing it, but she does it while they are *still in the water*. And doddering old Gandalf doesn’t even get credit for the horses in the foam.

*1:30 Elrond plots to manipulate Frodo…*  
 Elrond and Gandalf spy on Frodo and Sam, and it is obvious that Elrond expects Frodo to carry the Ring away from Rivendell. Frodo’s single most important moment of agency in the entire story is taken from him. Also, we see that Gandalf somehow recovered his staff from Saruman, but at this point, who cares about continuity?

*1:38 The Council of Idiots…*  
 Ohmigod this scene. What was originally a discussion of events and a council of war debated among the various representatives of the free peoples turns into Boromir almost taking the ring, Gandalf reciting the verse complete with Surround Sound &amp; Lighting Effects, Gimli trying to destroy it with his axe and everyone squabbling like children. 

JB&amp;W took something reasoned and intelligent and made it loud and stupid. I want to punch this scene in the teeth. I’m glad they removed Bilbo, he deserves better. Then they end it by fucking up Frodo’s most important moment so that he has to shout “I will take the Ring!” three times. No, quiet dignity and strength is only for Aragorn, silly Hobbit!

Followed by the awful “My sword! My bow! My axe” scene, because, in this version, they’re just volunteering rather than being chosen. And Merry &amp; Pippin, now **REALLY HERE FOR NO REASON**, declare they will have to be bound in a sack to keep them from going.

Then… oh god, then… they actually wrote down the fucking title and *made Hugo Weaving say it.* “You will be the Fellowship of the Ring!”

*1:52 Gimli suggest going through Moria…*  
 Of all the changes made by JB&amp;W this one confuses me the most. Moria was a huge Dwarven city, Balin decided to retake Moria over thirty years before the Fellowship set out, and he has been presumed dead for decades. There has been no word from Moria, but Gimli seems to think it’s viable and operating. “My cousin Balin would give us a royal welcome.”

Gimli being ignorant of Moria’s status while both Gandalf and Aragorn fear that it is a death trap is a really bizarre story choice. It makes no sense logically, and it doesn’t make any sense structurally. I can’t figure out why they thought this was “better” in any way. Even Saruman (Sauron’s proxy as a villain all through this trilogy) seems to know there’s a Balrog waiting in Moria.

*1:55 Saruman can do anything…*  
 Saruman seems to have no limits in this film. He uses the crows as spies. He controls the weather. He causes a landslide in the pass of Caradhras. He calls lightning from hundreds of leagues away… it’s just too much. This isn’t how magic works in Tolkien’s world, but we’re not in Middle-Earth, we’re in a mediocre D&amp;D adventure where the bad guy knows *everything*. Then Gandalf defers to Frodo, who has no idea what the options are or what they mean. 

*2:02 Gandalf can’t open the doors…*  
 Doddering old Gandalf can’t even come up with the answer. Frodo, the sudden riddle-master (it isn’t a riddle at all, but whatever) has to figure this out? Why did they even bring Gandalf? Once they get in to what is obviously an unlit, disused, long-abandoned entrance, Gimli, who is plainly delusional, says, “Soon, Mr. Elf, you will enjoy the fabled hospitality of the Dwarves. Roaring fires! Malt beer! Red meat off the bone!” It makes NO SENSE.

Imagine having to go through the remains of Fukushima to get somewhere. You know there was an accident, and people went in thirty years ago to do cleanup but there has been zero communication. Why, upon reaching the desolate, abandoned outskirts, would you announce how great it will be?

*2:13 Pippin knocks every piece of metal in Moria down the well…*  
 No scene better illustrates what’s wrong with Jackson’s change in tone than this one. In the book, Pippin, fascinated with the well, drops a pebble down it. After a long fall, there’s a quiet *plunk*, followed long minutes later by the sound of far away drums. It’s an incredibly real moment. A young, impulsive character indulges what seems like a harmless but irresistible whim.

In Jackson’s Bigger, Dumber, Louder, Improved version, Pippin feels an arrow in a body, the head in armor falls off followed by the entire body, a huge iron chain, a ’55 Buick Roadmaster and anything else that could be comically, absurdly loud. At that point, OF COURSE there are drums because it’s a MOVIE MOMENT.

*2:21 Cave-Trolls and Spider-Orcs…*  
 Again, Frodo gets to cower. In the book, he stands side-by-side with Boromir, cries “For the Shire!” and stabs the troll’s foot with Sting, which wounds the troll. Here he runs, cowers, whimpers, makes one lame slash and is hammered by the troll in such a way that, even if the spear didn’t penetrate the Mithril, his innards would be jelly.

Next they run for the bridge and the orcs pour up from the floor and… out of the ceiling? Hundreds of orcs can suddenly defy gravity, crawling like spiders down the pillars, a super-power they have never had before in any version of the stories, and one they never display again. All for a stupid visual.

*2:26 Gandalf holds the bridge against the Balrog…*  
 This sequence makes me angry because it works **so well**, and the reason it works is because it is almost verbatim from the goddamned book! It is proof that, had J,B&amp;M just *trusted* the source material, they would have had a film with so much more depth, power and meaning.

*2:42 The Mirror of Galadriel…*  
 This was when I knew the problems were bigger than I imagined. The removal of Sam, and his vision of Bagshot Row being torn up, was the harbinger of Jackson having removed the Scouring of The Shire. They also fucked up Galadriel’s dialogue for no rational reason; “Things that are yet to come to pass” is a helluva lot less elegant than “Things that yet may be.”

*2:59 Aragorn forgets what movie he is in…*  
 When JB&amp;W threw out the plot point about an eventual choice of whether to go to Mordor, Minas Tirith, or split the Fellowship and take different paths, they apparently didn’t care that they also threw out Boromir’s reason for joining. Had Boromir been told (as he was in this film) that the Fellowship was *never* going to Minas Tirith, he would have ridden home like a good solider to advise Denethor. Instead, he tags along hoping to… what? Wheedle the Ring away from Frodo? Was Boromir instantly ensnared at the Council of the Stupid?

After his confrontation moments earlier in which Aragorn announces he would not bring the Ring within 100 miles of Minas Tirith, that should have been the last straw. Boromir either needs to take it and go, or simply go. But follow he does. When they stop at Parth Galen, *everyone* should have abandoned Aragorn when he forgets what world he’s in and says, “Orcs patrol the eastern shore. We must wait for cover of darkness.”

So… The chief of the Rangers, who has been fighting orcs for 60 years and understands that they are almost completely nocturnal; bred in darkness, hunting and fighting in darkness; and even though there are “new” orcs that move and fight in daylight, they are still *orcs*… this Ranger decides to *wait for the cover of nightfall?!?*

Of course, this is because the writers removed their reason for stopping. There is now no course to be chosen, but they still need Frodo to encounter Boromir alone in the woods. In this version, this valiant band of intrepid heroes simply fail to notice both Frodo and Boromir sneaking away. Apparently, Boromir is the only member of the party with eyes, ears and a brain. 

This moment makes everyone else an idiot. Frodo is an idiot for going off on his own. Sam is an idiot for losing track of Frodo. Aragorn and Legolas are *literally* on the lookout for threats but miss a full-size man in chain mail sneaking away. And Merry, Pippin and Gimli are just idiots most times, full stop.

*3:01 Boromir has Frodo in his grasp…*  
 The Ring makes you invisible, not intangible. Boromir has both hands gripping Frodo’s vest, and yet Frodo puts on the Ring and Boromir somehow… loses his grip? Uhmazing!

*3:03 Frodo gets permission to leave…*  
 This moment. **This fucker right here.** This, more than anything else, displays the actual contempt Jackson, Boyens &amp; Walsh have for Tolkien’s work and his characters. In the book, of course, Frodo realizes the Ring will twist the mind of *anyone* near it and so he must go alone. He makes this decision and goes off, saving only that Sam refuses to be left.

But Jackson’s Frodo is just baggage. He has no agency, gets to make no decisions. He merely bounces and runs from event to event. And Aragorn must be *Our Hero!* He cannot doubt, he cannot be uncertain. Frodo tells him he must go alone and Aragorn consents. He ***CONSENTS???*** 

Aragorn agrees to send Frodo off alone, followed by Gollum, with no map, no guide, and no idea of where he is going. Aragorn thinks this is a ***GOOD IDEA?!?*** 

Never, under any circumstances, would anyone who understood or cared about these characters write this scene. Aragorn’s flaw is his arrogance. He might send everyone else off to Minas Tirith, but he would *never* abandon the Hobbits, confident that her could resist the Ring. (And perhaps he could; he never seemed tempted on the long march to Rivendell, or at any point between there and the Argonath)

**Choose** to send them off **alone?** Go. Fuck. Yourself.

But Jackson’s Aragorn isn’t a person; he’s a Hero. An archetype. He cannot be so easily fooled or have choices taken away from him. He *must* be in command of the non-humans *at all times*. 

This choice by the writers breaks so much of what comes after it can never be fully recovered. The breaking of the Fellowship was supposed to be a chaotic moment of panic followed by an agonizing choice of what to do next. It is the moment when Aragorn truly becomes a leader because he is forced to make a hard choice. Prior to this, he has had Gandalf and Galadriel and the river Anduin to guide him. Under his leadership, everything goes wrong, and that is important. It makes deciphering Frodo’s tracks and choosing to pursue Merry and Pippin *matter*. 

That is too much complexity for Jackson’s Aragorn. No hard choices for him. “Yes, Frodo, you go. I have a huge, overblown action scene to insert myself in! After that, I know *exactly* what to do!”

This is when I actually felt hate for this film. It is unforgivable.

*3:05 Aragorn is INVINCIBLE!*  
 OMG this stupid, stupid fight scene. It’s bad enough that 60+ orcs in full armor (yes, I counted, and that’s just in that shot; seems closer to 100) were able to sneak up on Aragorn in the woods. Then he wades into them and hold his own. Sixty. Uruks. Who, apparently, only have bows when they face Boromir.

And the orcs come within a rat’s ass of catching Frodo; they see him, they chase him; but valiant Merry and Pippin distract the orcs and Frodo the baggage runs away again. Meanwhile, Merry and Pippin stand like the idiots they are while an orc, ordered to bring them in alive, comes at them with an axe and HEEEEERE’S BOROMIR!

Finally Lurtz the super-orc *remembers he has a bow (not that he knows how to draw it)!* And it fires arrows the size of fence posts! Because *of course* it does. All to add a ten-minute-long action sequence that isn’t even in the damned book. 

*3:15 Sam rejoins the movie…*  
 And now, here’s Sam, running back to the boats from wherever the hell he went for the last 12 minutes that he didn’t find a single member of the company or a single orc. In the book, of course, he actually reasons out what Frodo is doing (the only one who does), but that’s far too smart for this hapless version of Sam Gamgee.

All kidding aside, now Jackson has to manufacture a moment of emotion for Frodo leaving. He builds it out of yet one more push in on the Ring in Frodo’s hand followed by voice-over of Frodo and a flashback of Gandalf, and it’s a castle of pure cheese. This would have all happened organically if they had just shot the ending of the book.

This ending also makes Frodo a complete dick. In the book, he is sneaking away with the Ring on, and Sam finds a boat letting itself out into the river. He runs in after and Frodo hopes Sam will give up and go back. This version of the “making the dog leave for its own good” scene is just embarrassing, and because it’s an argument, it makes Frodo seem incredibly callous.

Then Sam drowns. For an hour. 

*3:18 And the rest is loud and stupid…*  
 It’s comedy after this. They send Boromir off in the boat without the weapons of his enemies. Aragorn loots the body, taking Boromir’s bracers for his own, ‘cuz that’s a thing you do to your friends and not out of character at all. Then, they all just watch Sam and Frodo go because this is Aragorn’s *decision*, remember.  

• • •

In the end, the problem is Peter Jackson, Philippa Boyens and Fran Walsh didn’t use the characters from the books. They used the uncomplicated, YA novel versions of them. Generic Old Wizard. Generic Fantasy Hero. Generic Dwarf. Generic Elf. And four Hobbits whom they seem to have forgotten were adults. It’s as if they treated the Hobbits like children because they are the size of children. One might think the men of Rohan wrote this script. 

If you’ve made it this far and think this is out of control, I’ll share that there were around 60 comments I didn’t make, or deleted. And that’s setting aside my issues with the technical filmmaking, which are many. 

Peter Jackson felt he could tell a *better* story than Tolkien. To my eye, all he did was tell a loud, simplistic, stupid version of a similar story.

Their argument was that Tolkien was not consistent with his spellings throughout the years and that the original spelling is not the same as it is today. Sort of a similar situation to how the Bible is a translation of a translation of a translation, so the meanings aren't always the same.

Multiple google searches of the origins of the name and differences between editions/printings brought up no results. They seemed confident in their argument (although they came off a bit tense) and I'm personally not knowledgeable enough to know about all the minute differences of each edition of the series. I felt bad not giving them the point since I went with what was on the card. The game even has a wiki for fans to submit corrections and that card wasn't listed as incorrect.

I've always been curious about Gandalf's (or any wizard's) abilities. Thinking back to the movies, every ""magic"" thing I can remember him doing seems to involve one of two things: 

* Talking to animals (Shadowfax, the Eagles, the butterfly that summons the Eagles)

* Creating light with his staff (holding off the Balrog, pushing back the Nazgul, scaring the orcs at Helm's Deep). He also pushed Sarumon out of Theoden's head, which may or may not have been using the staff in the same way, I'm not sure

His other feats, that I can remember, were all related to being really old/wise/respected, not magic.

He can't seem to communicate over a distance or teleport or anything like that, since he always rides a horse when he's in a rush. When fighting in Minas Tirith, he doesn't use any magic, he just fights (awesomely) with his staff as a melee weapon.

I remember Saruman threw a fireball once, but I don't think Gandalf ever did anything like that.

I'm just curious if the White Wizard's magical abilities mostly involve communicating with nature and having a staff that can emit ""good"" or ""holy"" light, or if there's more to it? Maybe he has other powers, but he holds them back in order to allow men/hobbits to reach their full potential, or something like that?",What are Gandalf's powers/abilities?

lotr,"After many hours spent reading and researching all of Tolkien's works, I have finally finished this project which I started over 2 years ago now. In a previous post I linked a spreadsheet containing all population and military size estimates for the 3rd Age. In a series of upcoming posts, I will be explaining my reasoning for each of the numbers starting with the Dwarves:




Blue Mountains: 10,500

 - My first thought when I started with the Blue Mountains Dwarves was that there was no real way of estimating the number of Dwarves that lived there. The only pieces of information that I had to work with were that many Dwarves moved out of the Blue Mountains to Erebor once it had been reclaimed, and that there were 3 of the 7 Dwarf Divisions inhabiting them (before the migration). I started by calculating the army that Dain would've possessed during the Battle of the 5 Armies. Dain brought 500-600 Dwarves to the battle, but likely left a large portion of his army back at home since it was a rushed call to action. He likely ended up only taking about 1/3 of his total military force. Assuming this, he would have 1,500 semi-professional soldiers at his command. Since Dwarves are a much more warlike than the other races of Middle Earth, it is safe to assume that this would make up around 1/8th - 1/9th of the total population of the Iron Hills at the time (this is also based on lower populations usually having larger percentages of their citizens in the fighting force). This would give the Iron Hills a population of 12,500 Longbeards. We can assume that this is roughly half of the Longbeard population, while the other half lived in the Blue Mountains. On top of this, there were the Firebeards and Broadbeams, though they no-doubt have smaller populations than the Longbeards since they had been nearly wiped out previously, as well as the Longbeards being the most predominant of the Dwarf races (likely about 1/5 - 1/4 the total Longbeard population for each race). This would mean that before the migration, the population of the Blue Mountains would've been roughly 18-20,000. With this in mind, we can assume around 1/2 of the total Blue Mountains population left for Erebor once it had been won back. This would leave the population with 10,000, and likely 10,500 by the War of the Ring (dwarves populate slowly, especially in the 3rd Age).

Erebor: 17,500

 - This one, with the above calculations already complete, is much easier to estimate. Assuming that 8-10,000 dwarves migrated from the Blue Mountains to Erebor, as well as a large portion of Dain's people from the Iron Hills (likely about 3/4ths of the 12,500 mentioned above), I estimate there were roughly 17,500 - 20,000 Dwarves residing in Erebor during the War of the Ring.

Iron Hills: 3,500

 - This was also very easy to estimate base on the above calculations. Since there were roughly 12,500 Dwarves living there during the Battle of the 5 Armies, and 3/4ths of them left for Dain's new kingdom in Erebor, we can make an estimation that there were 3,500 dwarves left behind to dwell in the Iron Hills during the War of the Ring (though they were likely called to Erebor to assist Dain in fighting the Easterlings).

Red Mountains: 31,500

 - Obviously, this number could be VERY inaccurate - in-fact, it's possible that there were no Dwarves living in the Red Mountains - but this is my best guess. It is largely accepted that the other 4 Dwarf divisions dwelled in the Red Mountains. Those being the Ironfists, Stiffbeards, Blacklocks, and Stonefoots. My estimation is that each of those races had less than half (for the purpose of the calculation, we'll assume 1/3rd) the population of the Longbeards (which, based on all my calculations above is around 20-25,000). 1/3*4 = 4/3,   4/3*22,500 = 30,000 Dwarves at the time of the Battle of the 5 Armies, and around 31,500 by the War of the Ring. Again, this is completely a guess since we have no real information about these Dwarves.

Other Dwarves: 2,500 - 15,000

 - There were likely other smaller groups of dwarves roaming/living in other mountains scattered across Middle Earth. I have no calculations to back this one up.





Let me know which of these numbers you would change and why. As these figures are not definitive, I am open to changing my numbers if it is for a valid reason.

lotr,"So, I'll start this off by admitting this probably doesn't have a simple answer, and since Tolkien did change his mind on things, from time to time, it might not even just have one, but...

Were the Orcs still Children of Eru? Did He abandon them?

They may, or may not, have once been Elves, twisted by the Dark Powers, but we are led to believe that they weren't made, as they were, by Eru Illuvatar; they were forged of something else by Melkor, who lacked the power to create on his own; only being able to twist what his father had already cast. It wasn't a simple process; fast or kind, and though I guess they could have simply resisted, till the end, and died, being swept back to Eru Illuvatar, at least some of those Morgoth took became Orcs, became loyal to him, and became evil. As they are, few others would show them love, or expect anything of the like from the orcs, in turn, but one might argue that, unlike the Numenorians, who were more simply corrupted of thought by Sauron, and punished for their transgression, the original would-become Orcs may have had no choice, being twisted beneath powers they had no hope of resisting.

And this will get me to Numenor, for a moment. I ALWAYS complain about the fate of Numenor; how an otherwise distant Illuvatar, who didn't step in, and intervene no matter the level of monstrosity was being loosed upon Arda, did his one Sodom and Gamorrah Old Testament moment, and obliterated the island of Numenor, and most of its inhabitants, after having Ar Pharazon, and his Great Armament swallowed up by the lands of Aman, for daring to sail into the Undying Lands. I always complain because it seemed an inflated sentence. He could have still lifted the Undying Lands, made the earth round, and left the Numenorian fleet sailing in circles, until starvation made them return home empty, but He didn't. Part of why this is, in my limited understanding, is that the Valar were forbidden to harm the Children or Eru; Manwe, Aule, Tulkas, and the others couldn't stop the Great Armament from reaching Valinor, and they had to instead beseech Illuvatar to intervene on their behalf, and so He did.

Well, what of the Orcs? Could the Valar harm them, in their many battles of the First Age? I won't bemoan that the Elves, the Dwarves, and the Men fought them; killed them. Had they not, the Orcs would have killed in turn, and they were rather monstrous, by this point, but it gets me back around to the question; were they still Eru's children, whatever their form, or simply fit for conflict, and destruction? Was there some truly twisted thing that Melkor, with his original level of power, as the greatest of the Valar, could do to them that changed them so much Eru would turn His gae away from them, and no longer see them as ""fit for purpose""? When they died, do we believe their souls still travel to Mandos, or were they so broken that they just poofed out of existence? Could they still live forever, if violence didn't find them, or were they rendered ""mortal"" by the machinations of Morgoth? Had He wanted to, and not used up His one intervention on Numenor, could Eru have ""saved"" the Orcs, or were they always intended as such, since none can act save in the will of Eru, and those who struggle to most will simply find they were given His most important parts to play?","Were the Orcs Still ""Children of Eru Illuvatar""?",1672527833

lotr,"He’s such a wonderfully manipulative bastard.  (Okay, not really, because he was was created directly from the mind of the Creator, he doesn’t actually have parents as such…)

I’m doing my yearly X-max to NY’s rewatch of all all 6 extended editions, and I’m in the middle of An Unexpected Journey.

When Thorin looks at Gandalf and says, “where are you leading us?”

Gandalf just glares at him and says nothing.

All i can think is, “Dude, you involved yourself in something that Gandalf set it motion.  By hook or by crook, the greatest Maiar ever to exist accomplishes his goal, no matter what it takes, and won’t prevent you from exercising your Eru given free will for a single moment.  What did you think was going to happen?”


Also, random note:  In the wake of Morgoth’s fall, Sauron was captured by his Eönwë and commanded to return to Valanar for judgement, as Maiar are explicitly forbidding from passing judgement on other Maiar.

So, Gandalf the White, having been returned from death by Eru itself, passes judgment on Saruman, breaking his staff with a word, casting him from the order, and leaving him a mortal (with only the power of his voice left to him).

So, does that mean that Gandalf is no longer a Maiar?  Is he now a Valar?  Is he something in between?

lotr,"I lost my grandpa this year. He was like a second dad to me. And he often did feel more like my dad than my actual father at times when our relationship was strained when I was young (don't worry, me and my dad are closer than ever now). 

If I had to describe him physically, and not just saying he was one of the kindest and gentlest people you could meet: he was tall (6 foot something, taller than my dad), had a big bushy beard as long as I knew him, a very deep voice and he was a lover of nature. I always loved going on walks through the woods with him when I was little (and we came across a bear one time!). Now, who does this sound like? 

For me, it's Treebeard. My grandpa's voice wasn't as deep as his obviously, but all the above attributes, and the fact that he also had a cadence in how he spoke like Treebeard, made me immediately think of him when he came onscreen. And upon this realization is when I started to cry. So much that my roommate heard me and checked on me thinking I was having a breakdown, and I was.

lotr,"Don't want to make this long, but I am curious about your opinion on this topic. The rings of power show obviously was not well received by fans of lotr, especially the books. I'm a filmmaker and I'm starting to think people have a misunderstanding of how to make a successful movie or show, especially in the fantasy genre. 

Fantasy media is a genre that almost requires an expensive budget to make the unbelievable believable. Only animation can achieve a lower budget. That being said you need your movie to be watched by as many people as possible to make your money back. 

I also believe following word-for-word source material is a surefire way to have a box office flop but a great fan score. Not want you want when your budget is hundreds of millions. These movies/shows aren't made for super fans that know the lore, they are made for as many people as possible to enjoy.  

Not sure about this subreddit, but I know there's a huge push against this so-called woke agenda in the media. The introduction of black characters and powerful women seems to rub people the wrong way (among other lore problems). What people don't understand is that it works, that's why Hollywood is doing it. Because that is what the mass audience wants to see, they just don't want an agenda behind it, just let it be. Meaning, let a black character be black, we don't need a monologue about racism in a story where that doesn't exist. House of Dragons did this very well. 

Just curious, do you guys believe an adaptation should be followed word for word despite losing money, or liberties are inevitable so that as many people as possible can enjoy?","In defense of ""The Rings Of Power""",1672437614

lotr,"I’m rereading Lord of the Rings for the Christmas season and I came across something interesting in the preface to the second edition in Fellowship. Tolkien says that the biggest problem with Lord of the Rings is it’s short length. I’m curious if he ever wrote of any additions he would have made to the text had he another chance to write the book. Personally, I feel like he would have developed the Fellowship a bit more maybe giving them another adventure or two, padded up Frodo and Sam’s story in Two Towers befor they reach the Black Gate, expanded on the lore surrounding Sauron and explain more about Mordor’s workings, maybe add some information about Haran, drawn out the Scouring of the Shire, and give a longer ending to the already long ending.

I am not. I was talking to a friend, and he mentioned there were flaws, and I said “Yes, but not that many,” and he told me that the biggest one is that there are no women. He felt ashamed when he read an article told him there were no women, and he had loved the book so much, he had never realized that it never featured female characters. I’ve never been bothered by this. I’m a woman. I still grew up with a mind loving fantasies. I still enjoy Tolkien without him adding ladies to every story. Perhaps some would get bored with all the bearded dwarves and such, but I read it like it’s a historical account. It just flows of the page, and I’ll read any fantasy or historical fiction novel with that much ease in writing. I don’t know.

However, in like the second chapter Gandalf also remarks that the ring did not intend to be picked up by hobbits, and that it must be the work of some other force. 

Having read a decent portion of the first book, I’m coming to understand that the world of Middle earth is insanely complex and there is so much shit at play.

lotr,"Something I notice when people talk about lord of the rings films is how the movies skip the fact Gandalf was away for 17 years and by the time Frodo left the shire he was 50, while I get it’s not that big of a deal (and let be honest it wasn’t that important) but let’s consider a few things that could lead to the 17 year time skip

1. Frodo not aging, we already saw this with gollum and Bilbo as both of them got extended lives due to the ring and Bilbo looking around 75 despite being 111, it’s not hard to say the same happened with Frodo and even if it wasn’t life extending magic there’s 50 year olds who still don’t look old, sure there’s Sam, Merry and Pippin who are younger but apart from pippin they would have been in their 20s

2. Barad Dur still being under construction, we see in the film that after Frodo gets the ring, the tower is both still being constructed but also only as far as the hill top, and when they’re at Bree and the forests the tower is completed, but then again these could just be future visions like when Gandalf tried to pick the ring up

Overall it is confusing on whether or not a 17 year time skip did occur or not in the films but in my personal opinion it’s likely a skip did occur but not as long, but overall too I think that the 17 years was not that important to the plot, I get alot of the confusion also is due to Thranduin telling Legolas to find Aragon despite Aragon being like 10 years old but let’s be honest if you take the Hobbit films seriously that was your first mistake",Theory: the 17 year time skip still occurs in the film,1672252011

1.) at one point Adar says summon the legions. A legion should be… one legion is 4,000-6,000 men…and by him saying legions it should’ve been a massive army of orcs. Instead it’s a couple of hundred and they get owned by the lame ass human village.

2.) does numenor not have an army? They make it look like it’s a bunch of ordinary citizens going to protect the queen. Also, they’re all training in the town square like it’s a little show. And to make matters worse….they only use 3 ships? 

3. The Mordor PowerPoint, I mean…cmon lol 

4.) the whole halbrandt thing. Did he mean to be in the middle of the ocean? Or is it just luck? Regardless, stupid way of introducing Sauron.

lotr,"What I don‘t understand in Tolkiens work is the concept of evil and the responsibilities evil acts have on the person who executes it. 
Let me explain: IIRC when Morgoth longed for the silmaril he started to manilpulate the Noldor. His dark whispers created the concept of evil inside the hearts of the elves. Greed, hubris and selfish pride where emotions/ thoughts the elves didn‘t know before. Am I right? Morgoth brought evil to Arda and everything he touched got infested with it. 
I know his whispers fell on fertile ground with the Noldor, but only his interference caused the distrust for the Valar and the following desaster. So the kinslaying was a direct consequence of Morgoth‘ actions.

The kinslaying was cruel, yes, but was it right for the Valat to punish the Noldor that hard? Wouldn‘t it be wiser to forgive and show them right way? Especially when the Valar should be wise enough to know that the Elves wouldn‘t stand a chance against Morgoth on the long run? 
I find it odd for them to say „Nope. You don‘t fit our society of white heroes anymore. Go f urselves and see how you will handle YOUR consequences!“ when all of this was caused by one of their kind. I don‘t get it. It feels wrong. Especially if you look onto the suffering that the Noldor got back thousandfold afterwards. The children of Illuvatar did not know evil until Morgoth told them. The Valar were their to guide elves and men.

I‘d really like to hear your approaches on this topic.",Evil and forgiveness,1673560799

Maybe it's that nostalgia that makes me a little biased, but I feel like the soundtrack genuinely captured the essence of Middle-Earth, especially the Shire and One Ring themes.

When I found an audiobook that plays samples of the music score in the background, I felt greatly more immersed in Tolkien's world, especially the scenes in Baggend.

I find the Shire's music to be both relaxing and comforting, but at times it proposes a spirit of wonder at times. Perhaps even a bit adventurous. The inclusion of the violin makes old timey and rustic while the flute gives it the feeling of people who are closer to nature. It overall feels simple, but still promises fullness. If that makes sense.

Then I feel the One Ring's theme creates vibes of something old and until recently lost. It feels charming yet oddly sinister. Ask if the darkness behind it is more subtle than anything else.

The description of the Rohirrim is also very similar to Anglo-saxon military organisation, with Theoden surrounded by the men of his house (huscarls), and the eodreds, led by other notables (ealdormen).

One aspect of Gandalf's character that I find particularly interesting is his decision to spare Saruman at the end of The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Many readers may see this as a weakness in Gandalf's character, but I believe that it is a crucial part of his development.

Gandalf is not a vengeful or cruel character. Throughout the trilogy, he is shown to be a wise and compassionate leader, and his decision to spare Saruman reflects this. Gandalf understands that Saruman is no longer the powerful wizard he once was, and that he is now a broken and bitter old man. Instead of punishing him, Gandalf chooses to have mercy on him and allow him to live out the rest of his days in peace.

Furthermore, Gandalf's decision to spare Saruman also shows his commitment to the greater good. He recognizes that it is more important to focus on the defeat of Sauron and the restoration of peace in Middle-earth, rather than seeking revenge on a fallen enemy.

In conclusion, Gandalf's decision to spare Saruman is not a weakness, but rather a demonstration of his wisdom, compassion and his commitment to the greater good. By sparing Saruman, Gandalf is showing his wisdom in understanding that Saruman is no longer a threat, his compassion in not wanting to punish a broken man and his commitment to the greater good in focusing on the defeat of Sauron and the restoration of peace in Middle-earth.",Why Gandalf's decision to spare Saruman is a crucial part of his character development,1673406197

lotr,"Thanos wanted to die.

Titan was dead. The pieces of land were moving around the sky, there was no green to be seen nor any living thing that walked or flew in the air. The seas, rivers and lakes seemed like they boiled. 
Only because they did not listen to him. 

*We could have ended this. If you weren't all so stubborn, we could have ended this. All would live, children would finally taste bread and the sky would be clear. But you destroyed it. All of you!*

That was it. He tried to fight back then. No longer now. It is over.

""I am done."" he said, looking over the wasteland. ""Maybe death will be kinder.""

""I am not so certain. Death is too final, is it not?""

He jumped. 
""Who is that?""

""Patience, my friend."" Thanos froze. The voice tha spoke to him was ancient, wise...and melodic and beautiful. ""Rashness is what cost your kind life, did it not?""

The person who stood before him resembled a Terran. But only slightly. They were tall and majestic to look at. Long white hair and a the ageless face made them seem like a god of Terran myths. A specimen of physical perfection. But most impressive (and terrible) thing Thanos noticed were the eyes: eyes of flame and ash, yet holding wisdom beyond time and space itself. And why they? Thanos could not guess what this was: male or female. But it looked androgynous, as if, as if...

*As if body is just a garment they wear, not important to them.*

Thanos fell to his knees.

The Stranger smiled. ""Oh...we have had a bit of a problem, have we not?""

Tha voice tone sounded like that of a male. He, then.
""Who...who are you?"" was all he could ask. ""Are you...a god?""

Thanos never believed in them. Not until now.

The Stranger passed by him, touching him on his bald head. ""It could be put that way. I was here before all things. Before Asgardians, before your masters and before even the Cosmos itself."" he smiled again. ""*All* of Cosmos.""

Thanos narrowed his eyes. ""You...you knew this would happen?"" he straightened up and clenched his fist. ""You let this happen?""

""Pardon, Thanos. Do not be so angry, my friend. What could have I done?"" he shrugged. ""Nothing but observe. You were right: your plan of random elimination would have saved the planet, but they did not listen to you. If they did, they would be alive right now.""

He sat upon a rock. His fair appearance and...cleanness made everything around him seem pathetic, weak, filthy and ruined. As if a dead world already wasn't those things. Even the way he was keeping his right hand behind or in his robe made him look more...divine.

Thanos grunted when he realized what the Stranger said. *He knows my name.* ""No. They didn't listen to me.""

""And what you predicted came to pass."" The Stranger reached out with his hand and, in little sparks, a cup filled with a red liquid was formed. Thanos backed away again, glancing at it, expecting a poison.

""Do not be disturbed, Thanos."" he drank from one side of the cup. ""It is a drink from Earth, my friend. You would like it.""

Reluctantly, he took it and drank a bit of it. The taste was sweet, but odd. ""Are you from Earth?"" 

The Stranger waved in a dismissive gesture. He did it with such boredom, as if everything around him was ashes compared to him. ""That little world is like as an ant is to you. Sure, they are ants who can talk, so they sometimes get my attention because of that, but otherwise, no. It could not mean less to me.""

""Xandar?""

""Now, they are rats that might be useful at something, but still no.""

""Then who are you?"" Thanos asked.

""Ah."" he almost scoffed, but from his mouth it sounded elegant. ""A good question. I have always wondered how to explain when some of you ask me. In an as accurate way as possible, without your mind being unable to understand it.""

Thanos groaned. ""I don't like riddles!""

""Ah, good!"" the Stranger waved again. ""They cost me much a thing at one point. But, let us not talk about me, Thanos: how about you? What will you do now?""
Thanos eased his temper and looked around, seeing he chaos, ruin and death that was around him. He stood up, sighing. ""Die."" he said. ""I will stay and die here.""

""Oh, please."" he said. ""As I have told you: death is so...final. Why not use the time and resources you have for something else?""

""Resources?"" he looked back at his guest, with gnashes teeth. ""My home is gone.""

""You still have established property in other systems. You do not have nothing.""

""My home and people are gone!"" he mouthed, turning away. He had cousins all around the universe actually: Eternals. Thena was the closest one and he even had a brother, Eros. But his people who raised him and his home from childhood: they were gone. ""I have nothing else to live for.""

""Untrue."" the Stranger repeated and crossed his legs. ""For example, you could make sure nothing like this ever happens.""

Thanos turned. ""How?""

""Quite simply, actually."" he said and smiled. ""Just do it with your own hand: eliminate half of life in the universe and all peoples will live to see another day.""
He stared at him for a time. He said it as if he was talking about changing garments and then going to the toilet to release oneself. 

""You're insane."" he said honestly. ""There is no such power anywhere in the universe.""

""No!"" the Stranger stood up and smiled again. ""Incorrect! Again. It is possible: definitively so. In fact, as easy as drinking water. You just need a couple of things to fulfill the task and make it mean something.""

""Yes. I totally believe you."" he himself almost smiled, though he did not find it funny at all. ""Please, enlighten me: what is it?""

""The Infinity Stones."" 

Thanos froze at the mention that. The story as old as time: Infinity Stones, that came to be at the very beginning of the universe, representing its aspects. It was said even one stone would give an individual incredible power. Countless people looked for them, fewer obtained them: it is said in stories that even Celestials, the masters and constructors of Thanos' ancestors, looked for them and desired them. 

*There are six of them, he thought, Space, Time, Mind, Reality, Power and Soul.*

""Myths."" he sighed. ""Lies of ancient people. They never existed.""

""Really?"" the Stranger walked slowly and gracefully, not making even a small sound. ""Then why"" he reached out with his right hand. ""am I holding one in my hand?""

The Titan backed away. In the Stranger's hand was a small, beautiful stone, shinning with the light of yellow star. He felt it speak to him. Calling him. Thanos had no words. He just stared at it, then at the Stranger.

""You,"" the Stranger smiled. ""already understand that this might be the only way to do it: if you eliminate half of all life, the other half will thrive and live in prosperity. You thought of that yourself, did you not?""
They called him a madman, but he knew it was true: for life to survive at all, one half needs to die. And I was right, even just on my planet.

""It is a pity what happened to your world. It was beautiful. But there are other worlds out there, with children born, living and dying in hunger. Those worlds are just as beautiful as yours was. Would you want others to die too?""

He thought about it. Power to save everyone, by myself. He could not protect his own, but he could protect others. He looked at the stone, uncertain what he admired more: its beauty or the power it will bring. 

Then he remembered who held it.

""How?"" he pointed at him, accusing him. ""Who are you? Your name: now!""

The Stranger shrugged again. ""I told you: someone who wants to help you.""

""I might be desperate, but I am not a fool."" he hissed. ""What do you want?""

""You are insulting me, Thanos!"" he laid his hand upon his chest in protest. ""My desire is nothing more than for you to succeed. You see, our objectives are merged with one another.""

He tilted his head. ""Our objectives?""

""Yes. Yours, mine...and my master's, of course."" 
He blinked. This creature, standing in front of him, looking like a god in mortal world, had a master he served. ""Your master?""

""Indeed."" he smiled. ""Surprised? Oh, well, you see Thanos, the most impressive and gifted creatures recognize the greatness of those above them. My master, you see, is the Great Lord: Lord of Highest Places and the Master of Fates. A great power that belongs to **him** is rightfully **his** and the Great Throne is **his** dwelling place. I, on the other hand..."" he shrugged. ""You can think of me as **his** High Priest.""

""And what does your...lord want?"" Thanos asked with despise in his voice. He always hated religious fanatics. *This one is not a god, but surely presents himself as one.*

The Stranger looked at the moon closest to Titan. Even it was red as blood.
""We have enemies: my master and I. You might have heard of them and, if you have not, you will, under right, or, should I say, wrong circumstances. They call themselves the TVA."" his face twisted in disgust. ""A group of fools who think too highly of themselves and who stand as annoying insects at your neck.""

""What is their crime?""

""They are keeping some of my colleagues back. But more importantly, they are keeping my master at bay.""

Thanos chuckled. ""Who'd you call him: Lord of Highest Places? Right... If he is so powerful, how come he is held by that group?""

""A group can hold a great beast in chains. Does that mean they are greater than the beast?""

Thanos' smile disappeared. ""No.""

""Indeed. I would even say one only fears that which is greater than him. Nevertheless, in this they succeeded: others are out there and my master cannot take physical form in the Cosmos. Only I am able to step into reality and only I am able to touch it. So master chose me as *his* voice and *his* eye in the Cosmos.""

Thanos looked back at the Stone, his eyes basking in its glory.

""And this,"" the Stranger grinned. ""is how you will help me. Go and find them: the Infinity Stones. They are the very weapons keeping my master chained outside of the Cosmos or, as some of you would call it, the Multiverse. Do with them what you will: bring balance, bring peace, bring bread and breath to the entire universe and you will be its Saviour!"" he raised his finger to point out. ""There is one condition, only one thing you will need to do to return the favor to me: when you are done with your mission, you will destroy the Stones.""

Thanos' jaw dropped. ""What?""

""You heard me well: destroy them. All of them. Reduce them to dust and ash. That will be enough to accomplish my master's desires.""

The Stranger's gaze cut Thanos deeper and was pulling him more than any word that he has spoken, or anyone ever, for that matter. The fiery eyes burned: burned for real. They daunted him and made him feel like a rat. He only had strength to make one response.

""Will it work?"" he asked. ""Do they have the power to do it? Will I be able to do it?""

""Absolutely!"" the Stranger said, almost laughing.  ""Once you have the Stones, it will be quick and easy. All you will have to do is this!"" he snapped his fingers. ""And half of all life will end, just as you intended. The only condition I give you is to destroy them. That is all we ask of you.""

""I don't care for power."" Thanos said. ""I will not care for Stones after they served their purpose.""

""Perfect. Then it will not be hard of you to destroy them."" 

Thanos glared at the Stone again. He could feel its power, its strength, its energy touching his mind and sending thoughts as if they were words. He could save the entire universe. He would not be a madman like they called him. *They would call me a Saviour.*

He took it.

""There, you see!"" the Stranger clasped with his hands. ""Then it is all arranged! We shall both get what we wanted.""

""You still didn't give me your name.""

The Stranger raised his right hand. Only now Thanos noticed it was missing one, index finger.

""I have had a fair share of them, but..."" he smiled. Smiled like a devil.

lotr,"Not necessarily which film is the best in either its theatrical or extended form (we all know that’s Fellowship of the Ring heh) but which film do you think is most improved by the additions of the extended scenes?

As much as I love the extended edition of Fellowship of the Ring, the theatrical cut of that film is also a god tier, 10/10 film that’s pretty much perfect. The extended cut hues a bit closer to the book and has a looser structure and more measured pace that recalls the writing of Tolkien, but since the film is a masterpiece in either form I’m not sure it greatly improves the theatrical cut.

Similarly, I consider Return of the King to be the most hit and miss of the three films in both the theatrical and extended cut. I think the extended cut does ultimately improve the film, we get Saruman’s resolution (even if the scene isn’t great the character deserved closure), some really great scenes like the houses of healing, Aragorn mastering the palantir (basically the conclusion of his character’s arc) a great scene with Frodo and Sam at the crossroads of the fallen king, as well as some great scenes in Mordor fleshing out their journey. And while I know many debate Aragorn beheading the mouth of Sauron you can’t deny it makes his line “For Frodo” that much more impactful. The additional paths of the dead scenes are kind of dumb, but I won’t throw out the baby with the bathwater. 

But ya know, I think Two Towers is the film that most improves with the extended edition. If I had a big knock against the theatrical cut of that film it’s that Jackson spent so much time focusing on Aragorn, Rohan, and the Battle of Helm’s Deep, he ended up relegating the hobbits to supporting roles. The extended edition fills out both Merry and Pippin as well as Frodo and Sam’s subplots very nicely, while also fleshing out our boy Faramir is some ways that greatly improve his character and storyline.

Overall, my vote goes to The Two Towers.",Which LOTR film is most improved by its extended edition?,1673392776

lotr,"-Sorry for bad translation- Fra to Eng.

I was 9 or 10 years old, it was in 2005 or 2006, I don't know exactly...

At that time, after school and during certain weekends, my friends and I used to go to a large park, near ruins, to play ""knights"", as they said.

No adults to watch us, no cell phones, no buildings, no roads, the immersion in our heroic marvelous universe was perfect.

There were about ten of us, boys and girls.  We had a lot of fun, I remember that the hours passed very quickly, too quickly.

In truth, we liked to mix all the universes that we liked at that time.

We had a lot of fun!  There were epic battles, knights equipped with wooden swords, magicians' staffs improvised with tree branches.

For the girls... Rather the princesses... The most miserable knights among us were transformed into magic horses, harnessed by jump ropes.

It was our universe, a mix of Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, our favorite cartoons and legends.

Me, I was a black magician, I was the bad guy.  My father, who is very handy, had made a magnificent magician's stick for me in a cherry branch during our holidays in Auvergne, enough to make all my friends jealous when I returned.

During a school trip, my older brother, meanwhile, had brought back a replica of the One Ring from Italy.

It wasn't mine but, although I wasn't allowed to use it, I really liked taking it on the sly to go and play in the park with my friends.

With this artifact in my possession, you can imagine that I was the most interesting.

Despite our young age, we liked to play in a very role-playing way, so I had become the most powerful, the strongest.

My friends were then particularly attracted by the precious.

And to avoid any effects of covetousness and envy by my comrades, I had crimped the One Ring at the end of my magician's staff.

So he was and would only be mine.

The battles were terrible, my magic was terrifying, growing, and the enemies bent under my power.

Until the day I stuck my stick in a cardboard shield.

In the heart of this park which was the scene of our confrontations, the ring had fallen.

It was only at the end of the battle, much too late, that I realized it...

Itt was then real tears that sprang from my body.

No more playing, it was no longer fun for anyone.

The cries of a child, who loses the object of the desire of all his comrades.

I had lost the Ring from Lord of the Rings!

Thus my friends helped me to search throughout the park, for hours, over several days, without ever finding the precious one.

That day, was it stolen from me?  I will never know.

A few years later, I returned to the park to remember the scenes of our heroic exploits, our merciless struggles, the countless losses, and the incessant marriages between knights and princesses, but also and above all to seek one last time the  'Ring.

I never found it, maybe it's still there?

Did someone, a child maybe, or worse an adult, find it before me?

They stole it from us.

He was mine. He is ours...

I know that the Blu-Ray Extended version of Fellowship has the blue-green tint to it, that makes it wildly inconsistent with the Theatrical version, which would be a pain to dodge around in my editing process, but I also know that 4K has smoothed out a lot of the definition of certain shots, specifically LOTR. Though it seems to fix the tint issues for Fellowship, I’ve also noticed the 4K versions have made some other interesting color changes, such as making Smaug’s gold abrasively yellow. 

Ultimately I would like to hear everyone’s opinions on which version they prefer in order to help me make my decision. I did notice there was the Ultimate Collector’s Edition of the films, that had both Blu-Ray and 4K, which would solve my conundrum, but marked down, it’s still about $200.

This never dinged anything in my brain until tonight on a rewatch: nobody knew Bilbo had the ring until that moment.

Also when Bilbo says 'precious', Gandalf comments how the ring has been called that before, but not by him. Did Gandalf at some point witness Gollum doing this?

I was hoping people could help me with this; what do we know about the other Dwarf clans that lived in Rhun? I mean the Stiffbeards, Stonefoot, Ironfists and Blacklocks. I can find very little about them, except that they came to the aid of the Longbeards during the War of the Dwarves and Orcs. And their approximate homeland was Rhun and the Red Mountains.

lotr,"When Gandalf calls Pippin a “fool of a took” many may have realized he just insulted Pippins entire family. But it goes deeper if you analyze the language a bit more. He is saying in less words the following ‘you are the biggest fool amongst an entire family of fools’. And yes in the books he did have that sentiment. But it goes deeper if you go back to the hobbit when Gandalf was looking for the 14th member he was looking for a hobbit that may have a bit of the old Took in him. The Took’s were known for being more adventurous (foolish in the eyes of other habits), kinder and more inquisitive. While the Baggins family was more stead fast, polite and learned. Bilbo was very well read mind you. Gandalf had a love hate real with the took household. He admired their willingness to go off on random adventures and the fact that Pippin was the most likely probably was a bit too much. Also if you take a closer look into Gandalfs action,  Pippin was the only one to receive harsh words from directly from Gandalf aimed directly at him. Yes he calls Denethor a madman but he says it to Pippin. Now if you believe this is because Gandalf hated Pippin and merely tolerated him. Or if you feel that Gandalf consoling Pipping numerous times in battle of Pelennor Fields shows that Gandalf was just frustrated his inquisitiveness and recklessness. Remember there is way more behind that “fool of a took” line.

Recently I rewatched all the extended editions of the Peter Jackson movies and I don’t know which one is my favorite now. Before rewatching them I would’ve said that fellowship was my favorite but now I’m not sure. Each film is so excellent and does things that the other 2 don’t do. Fellowship is so good at getting you sucked into the world and learning the characters and there’s a ton of emotion too. Two Towers continues the momentum and emotion that part 1 left off on in such a great way, and the journey with the characters is so good and satisfying to watch that it rivals the first film. Return of the King knocks it out of the park with concluding the story; showing where all the characters end up and how the story ends up in a very melancholy way.

lotr,"Tldr; Which order should I re-read all the books for the 2nd time. 1st time was Hobbit, LOTR, Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales.

Alright my fellow lotr friends. I am very close to barking upon my second ever re-read of Tolkein's works, and I am having a bit of a problem deciding which order to do things in.

First, allow me to say that as a young man, I loved the PJ film adaptation, and I am saving my rewatch of the trilogy for AFTER this re-read. I thoroughly enjoyed the movies and some PS2 or PS3 game I played back in the day, always wanted to read the books. As I grew older, I delved more deeply into the lore of various fantasy worlds (Star Wars, Star Trek, The Witcher, The Last of Us, Horizon Zero Dawn etc..) but I was always saving the best for last.

I knew that consuming Tolkein would be an adventure on it's own, but the more I delved into little YouTube videos about why the Hawks didn't fly The Fellowship to Mordor, or why Gimli was so devastated in Moria, I started remembering all the questions I've heard, with answers I didn't fully understand over the years.

-Why did Gandalf survive the fight with the Balrog?
-Why does the ring slip off fingers?
-Do Elves live forever?
-Who is Sauron?
-Who built all these ruins you see throughout the movies?


Whenever I heard the answer to these questions, it left me with MORE questions. What is a Maiar? What do you mean the Eagles aren't just Eagles? 

I am delighted to tell you that I have, slowly but surely, attained the answers to my life-long questions through both YouTube videos, and good old fashioned Tolkein at his finest.

I began my journey with The Hobbit, after learning about Tolkein's life experiences, I found it fascinating reading through this book with my new knowledge.

Continued with the Lord of The Ring. WOW! What an amazing set of books, I can't even begin - and won't bother to bore you - with describing the beauty of the world, and the talent which Tolkein so lovingly wrote this amazing piece of masterful literature. Finally gave me my proper introduction to the story how it SHOULD be told.

I bravely followed this up with The Silmarillion. I was always intimidated by this series of stories the most. However with a little bit of YouTube summaries to help hash out the finer details, I would like to think I had a pretty good understanding of what happens in the three ages, from an overall perspective. I may not be quite to the level where I can always name names and events or places correctly, but I understand the Creation myth, I understand the First and Second age events overall and the Third Age just kinda flew by. I found The Silmarillion to be very well written (notnthat it means anything coming from me) and although st times a tad taxing, I did find the varied and intertwined stories to be compelling.

Now I am nearly 2/3 of the way through The Unfinished Tales. Tying up the loose ends I have always wanted to know about. I loved the tale of Turin, I feel I am getting substantially better at reading Tolkein and understanding his flow at this point. I am cherishing the last bit of Tolkein's tales before I have finished.

Now, the re-read order I am considering is beginning with  The Silmarillion, The Hobbit, LOTR and any Unfinished Tales I want to hear again.

Should I go in this order? Or should I cut right to the juice and go straight back in to the whimsical nature of The Hobbit I've been missing these past 30 years of my life.

I’ve been thinking about just going ahead and starting Shadow of War next, but I haven’t really collected all of the artifacts or completed all of the weapon quests. I was wondering if there was really anything else to fully gain from them outside of a sense of completion?

Also as a side question, what’s the general consensus of this game and its story? I’m not very big in the lotr fanbase and have only a bit of knowledge on the lore so I don’t know if this game is considered a black sheep or considered amazing by the fan base. Personally enjoyed the game a decent bit and thought the nemesis system as a whole was a cool concept. Plus commanding Uruks and the different beasts was really fun.

One thing I'm curious about, I don't recall from the books, and I haven't found an answer searching this forum, but this particular name I mention above.

I understand the implications of what ""Stormcrow"" represents and I believe Grima also makes the same implication in the movies.  Was Gandalf referred this way in Rohan and in Edoras in the years prior to him arriving in Edoras with the members of the Fellowship (absent Samwise and Frodo) or is this only a title thrust on him by Théoden while under the influence of Saruman?

When riding into Rohan, as Gimli says ""you'd find more cheer in a graveyard"" but I'm not sure if this is a product of the displeasure of seeing Gandalf come to town, a product of the current scenario in Rohan, or both?

Additionally, when counseling Théoden, at least in the film, the king gives a tepid glance at Gandalf as Gandalf counsels him.  Again, not sure if this is a product of past dealings with Gandalf or the fact he's just been freed of the control of one wizard and is concerned that another wizard will simply do the same.",Gandalf Stormcrow,1672795172

lotr,"Since it's Tolkien's birthday:  There are Tolkien fans in the sword and sorcery community. But that bunch (which I'm a junior member of), doesn't look to epic/high fantasy the way most Tolkien fans do.

But Anglachel has always stood out to me as having a very sword and sorcery feel. Much more than the rest of The Legendarium. This is from [a rather long essay I wrote](https://www.blackgate.com/2018/04/02/tolkiens-magic-sword-anglachel-2/) on Anglachel:

TURIN SPOILER AHEAD (Though you should know Turin's tale if you're reading this)

 'While magic swords are common in the modern fantasy/RPG world, they  were rare and prized in Middle Earth. Anglachel could cut through iron  and it glowed with a pale fire, which truly marked it as a wondrous  blade. It was also sentient, though that is not revealed until the end  of its tale. Horrified to discover that Niniel was really his sister,  Turin addressed the sword:

&gt;“Hail Gurthang! No lord or loyalty dost thou know, save  the hand that wieldeth thee. From no blood wilt thou shrink. Wilt thou  therefore take Túrin Turambar, wilt thou slay me swiftly?’ “

And from the blade rang a cold voice in answer:

&gt;“Yea, I will drink thy blood gladly, that so I may forget  the blood of Beleg my master, and the blood of Brandir slain unjustly. I  will slay thee swiftly.”

By mentioning Brandir’s unearned death and speaking of loyalty to  Beleg, Gurthang’s words indicate that it wasn’t animated by the essence  of Eol. The sword wants to allow Turin to right his wrongs by letting  him kill himself. This is quite different from the dark malevolence of  Elric’s Stormbringer, which delights in stealing the souls of the albino  prince’s friends. Stormbringer is revealed to be a demon, and it speaks  to Elric at the end of the epic saga, “I was a thousand times more evil  than thou!”

However, if we dismiss Eol’s dark character as the source of  Anglachel’s intelligence, there is no other indication of where the  sword drew its abilities from. We could infer it was a combination of  Eol’s craftsmanship and the meteorite iron, but that’s just pure  guesswork.'

lotr,"  Sigh. What is there to say about *The Two Towers* other than “What a fucking mess.” 

At least with *Fellowship*, you can pick apart the elements that Jackson, Boyens &amp; Walsh “improved” and explain why they feel so disrespectful to the books. There are also moments (a few) that genuinely *feel* like Tolkien.

This film is mostly just 8 hours of stupid crammed into a 4-hour bag. It’s impossible to truly analyze what’s wrong with this film because so little is right. In that regard, I’ll just stick with the broadest of strokes.

People in this forum often challenge me as to why I dislike the PJ films so much, so, by request, here’s a breakdown of what I find so offensive about the Extended Edition of *The Two Towers…*

*•* *•* *•*

*:03 Gandalf &amp; The Balrog fall for an hour…*  
 Okay, I promised not to nitpick but I kinda can’t resist. I know Gandalf said, “Long time I fell, and he fell with me,” but there’s a difference between “A long time” and “Holy shit, still falling.” Gandalf and the Balrog fall for 71 seconds. For the record, that’s a fall of over 15 miles. I *think* that’s probably excessive.

*:04 Sam &amp; Frodo…*  
 I will admit, now that PJ&amp;W are forced to treat them as main characters, Frodo and Sam are suddenly a lot closer to their book personalities. Without all the Important Characters to look after them, PJ has no choice but treat Sam &amp; Frodo like adults. Sam is capable, and Frodo is no longer a cringing coward, paralyzed by fear, and it’s refreshing. For this first bit, before JB&amp;W start “fixing” the plot, this actually feels like *Lord of the Rings*.

*:14* *Sméagol promises nothing…*  
 An incredibly important moment JB&amp;W either didn’t understand or didn’t care about. Sméagol has to **speak his promise to the Ring**. That’s how the magic, the control, the prophecy of it works. 

“Sméagol will swear never, never, to let Him have it. Never! Sméagol will save it,” and “I will serve the master of the Precious!”

Sméagol **must** say these things (or something close to them) to build for himself the clever trap that forces his own doom. The Ring compels the completion of both of these oaths. In the film all he says is “I will serve the master…” but that’s nothing.

*:18 Orc noses and Aragorn’s intuition…*  
 Not only can orcs climb down walls once per movie, they can also scent men an entire day’s run away (once per trilogy, because they never smell anyone who might surprise or overtake them again). And then Aragorn *instantly* knows the orcs have scented them! 

*:20 “And the union of the Two Towers…”*  
 STOP putting the fucking title into dialogue, Jackson, you hack! It is completely stupid and unnecessary. Of course this is followed by the most absurdly arch order to burn Fangorn that Christopher Lee could possibly contrive. *This thing will be your undoing; let’s say it out loud to make sure everyone knows you’re destroying all the trees!*

*:22 Burn this pointless village! We need an action scene!*  
 It really is so dumb. Yes, Saruman was able to raise the wild hillmen and the Dunlendings, but we didn’t need to waste the screen time watching this village being attacked.

It is also a really ham-fisted way to introduce characters to show Éomer finding Théodred (who was supposed to have been 41, BTW, not this pretty boy) just to take him home to die. We shouldn’t be meeting these characters until our leads meet these characters. It’s just crappy storytelling.

*:25 The Grima &amp; Théoden Show…*  
 There’s a part of me that really thinks Jackson was playing these characters as comic relief. Both Théoden and Wormtongue are presented in such ridiculous, over-the-top, comic-opera extremes he cannot possibly have wanted this to taken seriously. Here’s Théoden from the book:

“Upon it sat a man so bent with age that he seemed almost a dwarf; but his white hair was long and thick and fell in great braids from beneath a thin golden circlet set upon his brow. In the centre upon his forehead shone a single white diamond. His beard was laid like snow upon his knees; but his eyes still burned with a bright light, glinting as he gazed at the strangers.”

Compare that to the old man who cannot even open his eyes and speaks only to Wormtongue in unintelligible mumbles. Again, JB&amp;W have proven they have literally zero subtelty. Every element must be heightened to the point of utmost stupidity. The Rohirrim are a proud, warrior people. Is it plausible that they would still follow a doddering old man who could neither stand nor speak? Everything about this version of Théoden and Wormtongue is ludicrous.

Then, when Éomer steals Gandalf’s thunder about Grima’s price, Jackson ACTUALLY HAS WORMTONGUE LOOK AT ÉOWYN! Is this a student film? 

Next, guards come to beat the crap out of Éomer. Who are these guys? Are they being paid by Wormtongue? They certainly wouldn’t act like this simply on his say. Again, for this rotten kingdom ploy to work, Théoden has to be the puppet, not a slobbering pile of suet.

*:31 The Riders of Rohan attack in the dumbest possible way…*  
 Guess the orc’s noses don’t work at night because they failed to smell horsemen and horses. I recognize there wasn’t the screen time for the Riders to harry and surround the orc band as they do in the book, but having them display even rudimentary knowledge of tactics for attacking from horse would have been nice. Instead, they just blunder in. At night when the orcs have the advantage of visibility. And use bows at close range with their own guys running around. But, yeah, what did I expect?

*:40 Treebeard kills Grishnak…*  
 I *really* hate this introduction of Treebeard. Not because it isn’t what happens in the book, but because it’s completely out of character. It is an incredibly *hasty* act, and gives the wrong impression of how Ents behave (or how Ents *should* behave) right out of the gate. Immediately, he involves himself in the affairs of the other races.

Yes, Treebeard hates orcs, but in the book he suspects Merry and Pippin of being orcs and waits to decide. This version of Treebeard doesn’t even jibe with the one we see later at the Entmoot who is so passive he has to be tricked into attacking Saruman.

*:42 The Dead Marshes…*  
 The Marshes the way it was written in the book is so much more cinematic than what ended up onscreen, it’s bizarre that Jackson changed it. In the original, the initial entry takes place after dusk, and the lights (which are referenced in the film but never seen; maybe an effect never got finished?) are all around. The faces are much more dimly visible and hypnotic. Then the wraith flies over and the lights go out. It’s a *great* visual. 

Instead, JB&amp;M had to have their second zombie moment, and instead of being glamoured, Frodo falls in and is assaulted by shrieking undead faces and it’s all shtick we’ve seen a hundred times. PJ did it better in *The Frighteners*.

Immediately after this, Frodo lies there masturbating the Ring. Because even the draw of the Ring had to be loud and stupid. Instead of fighting until almost the end, we’re literal screen *hours* away from Mt. Doom and Frodo has already lost the battle. IT’S TOO FUCKING MUCH, PETE!

*1:05 The Elven cloaks are from Harry Potter…*  
 Of *course* Sam falls off a cliff near the Black Gate and of *course* two Easterlings come to investigate. Frodo wraps them in his Elven cloak and the observant Easterling stops three literal inches from the hem of the cloak and yet, in broad daylight, cannot see them. It is so over-the-top dumb I was expecting Frodo to have grown a lightning bolt-shaped scar when he finally opened the cloak (which has become a much larger molded stone covering).

*1:10 Merry &amp; Pippin are still idiots, and Old Man Willow is in the wrong film…*  
 Why do Merry &amp; Pippin have to have a scrambling pratfall argument about Merry drinking the Ent draught. Can’t Merry just… drink the fucking water…? Do we have to *witness* them growing, complete with gassy sound effects? 

And then here’s Old Man Willow, fresh from The Old Forest, just in time to make it seem like Treebeard isn’t even in charge of the trees *in his own Enthouse*, much less the rest of the forest. Because heaven forfend we go more than 4 minutes without a forced, unmotivated action sequence.

*1:19 The scuffle before Théoden’s throne…*  
 It’s been five minutes. Time for ACTION! Instead of allowing Gandalf to command the room, as he does in the book, the men of Théoden’s house rush in for a quick fistfight with Aragorn and the boys while Gandalf *actually casts the spell* to release Théoden. The subtle elegance of the book, *did Gandalf use magic or just psychology to get Théoden out of his chair?* We can’t have that. 

No, in Jackson’s world, Gandalf has to actually say “I release you from this spell!” But that’s not enough! No, he has to light the room with his white cloak, and apply electro-shock with his staff, jolting Théoden in his chair Once! Twice! Thrice! Complete with sound effects and a cutaway to Saruman flying across the room!

It is. So. Dumb.

In this world, Théoden is a barbarian king and wants to kill Wormtongue, depriving him of the delicious guile he displays in offering Wormtongue mercy by offering to let him ride into battle. Then, Jackson sets up Aragorn to immediately undermine Théoden’s renewed authority by stopping him from exercising his vengeance. The only person in this scene with motivations that make sense is Wormtongue.

*1:30 Helm’s Deep is a stupid idea…*  
 Nothing that happens in Jackson’s film after Gandalf Abracadabras Théoden makes sense. In the book, he counsels Rohan to make war against Saruman so the threat of Isengard will not be on the flanks of Gondor. They ride out, hoping to reach the Ford of Isen before the defense there has faltered, but they are too late. Word reaches them of the rout, and they fall back to Helm’s Deep at Gandalf’s urging.

In the movie, they spend a long time burying Théodred (whom the audience never knew, and there was no narrative gain to having alive at all), after which Théoden refuses to ride to war, and instead heads directly for Helm’s Deep (with *all* his people), which Gandalf thinks is a terrible idea. This is just pointless meddling with the story to add needless conflict between Gandalf &amp; co. and Théoden, and it makes the plot pointless. 

Apparently, in this movie, there are no keeps in Dunharrow? Why would Théoden then not simply head for Minas Tirith? Wormtongue makes a point of telling Saurman the road to Helm’s Deep is dangerous and slow. No one has any clear motivations at this point; it’s just a bunch of word salad designed to get to a huge battle, which is Jackson’s only goal for this film.

*1:35 Aragorn absolutely leads Éowyn on pointlessly…*  
 In the book, Aragorn is incredibly careful not to flirt with Éowyn. He recognizes that she wants him, and he gently, but firmly, shuts her down. It’s noble and honest. A bit cold-hearted, but he is part Elven (well, in the book; Viggo has a beard so Jackson’s Aragorn is plainly 100% human, but whatever). 

Here, Jackson has Aragorn flirting with absolute intent, just to say later, “oh, sorry dummy, my heart is taken.” It’s a shitty bro-move, and unworthy of the character.

*1:45 The Hobbits are idiots again…*  
 Sam &amp; Frodo’s brief time of being capable adults is all done, because now there are Important Humans about. While in the book, they realize Faramir’s men are near and hide, leaping out to make an impossible stand and thus impressing Faramir and his men, PJ has them bumbling into Faramir, falling on their asses and begging for mercy. No bold bravery here, just pathetic little people.

*1:55 PJ Sends in THE WARG RIDERS!*  
 What is there really to say about this stupid, pointless warg rider attack? Obviously, JB&amp;W felt they had gone too long without an Action Sequence! so we get this. It does nothing to forward the story, depletes Théoden’s forces to a comically small number, and inserts the so, so absurd “Aragorn is dead! He fell off a cliff!” beat. Everything about this is wrong.

The whole sequence ends with Wormtongue saying “But my lord, there is no such force!” only to be shown Saruman’s army arrayed below, so there must be some secret hidden entrance into Isengard because somehow Wormtongue didn’t pass or see these “tens of thousands” of orcs on the way in.

*2:10 Elrond prophesies Arwen’s ending…*  
 I actually really appreciate them including Arwen’s miserable end from the Appendices; a lot of people never read them, and fail to understand how few happy endings there are in Tolkien’s world. Most roads lead to sorrow. My only complaint is that it is so cheesily done, with Hugo Weaving chewing all the scenery and spitting it right into the camera. With even the slightest touch of subtelty, this moment woulda been beautiful.

Then, of course, it all goes to shit with Galadriel’s telepathic infodump (to Elrond, I guess?) for those who haven’t been following along. 

And, of course, Anborn knows Théoden has taken his people to Helm’s Deep even though there’s literally no way they could know this. Also, apparently, Osgiliath *just fell*; in his flashback, Denethor tells Faramir “but for you, this city would still be standing.” 

Weird because Osgiliath was ruined 500 years earlier, and looks it, and Faramir doesn’t seem quite that old. Gondor had retaken both banks about 20 years earlier, but then lost the east bank a year before the movie. Not sure what this memory is of them reclaiming Osgiliath. Just an opportunity for Denethor to be a dick.

*2:30 Faramir is just another thug…*  
 Tell me again how Peter Jackson does not have complete contempt for Tolkien’s characters? Faramir is *different* from Boromir. That is the entire point. That is why Denethor despises him. Faramir has studied with Gandalf, has a mind for history and strategy, and Faramir is not arrogant. But Jackson can’t abide subtlety or shades of grey, or the Faramir, who encounters the ring and turns it away, saying “Not if I found it on the highway would I take it.”

*This* Faramir lets his guards kick the shit out of Gollum. This Faramir is shifty and untrustworthy. This Faramir declares the Ring will go to his father, even *knowing* Denethor would become a tyrant if given it. Because in Peter Jackson’s universe, the Ring would already have won and Frodo been killed for it because *all* men are *instantly* susceptible.

Following this, Aragorn finally rejoins the movie already in progress, having taken a pointless little holiday in the river Isen.

*2:45 The Fucking Goddamned Elven Archers…*  
 No. No, Peter. You do not get to ignore *everything* about Tolkien’s lore and go unscathed. The elves Do. Not. Fight. This. Fight. For all the reasons you ignored, and everyone else already knows. The elves are leaving the fighting to men. Period. Fuck you and Fran and Philippa for deciding to include them. Absolutely no. The Last Alliance was the LAST. You DO NOT get to make a NEW one.

Worse, they are from “Elrond of Rivendell,” but they’re archers of Lorien, so it doesn’t make any logical sense either.

SO much is so dumb about this battle sequence. Relegating Gimli to comic relief status by putting him on the battlement, where he would never be in the first place. How easily the wall is overrun. The orcs being so much stronger than men as opposed to relying on strength in numbers. The orc running with the Olympic flame. The breach in the wall being replaced by a huge explosion (with Aragorn on top of it, naturally). Gimli jumping directly onto a field of upraised spears and missing all of them. The archers charging, instead of, y’know, shooting arrows. The Dwarf tossing. The ridiculous giant siege ladders going up fully loaded.

The goddamned shield. How did any of you ever forgive Legolas and the goddamned shield?

*2:58 The Ents decide not to go to war…*  
 I’m guessing primarily because they decided yes in the book. And, of course, because no one gets to be heroic but the heroes, so we have to set it up that Pippin *directly* leads the Ents to war.

*3:11 Faramir drags Frodo to Osgiliath…*  
 Just the cherry on top of making Faramir a myopic dickhole in this version. He sends the Hobbits off to Denethor, which means he *was* resisting the power of the Ring. He didn’t try to take it for himself. He is *choosing* to send it to someone he knows will do terrible things with it. But, yeah, JB&amp;W didn’t make any important changes to the characters at all…

*3:16 Gandalf returns with Éomer…*  
 So, the Elven archers (all of whom seem to have died by this point) were able to get here on foot from Lorien *before* Gandalf and the remainder of the Riddermark were able to arrive? Given that, in Jackson’s version, Gandalf brings these guys rather than the Huorns, this really seems like far too little, far too late. Especially since *none* of these horses would survive the charge down that hill.

Also, are both Éomer and Gandalf stupid enough to just charge into an entire wall of set pikes? Seriously, this is cavalry 101. Do Not Ride Into Pikes. Yeah, the sun comes up right behind the charge, but the pikes are still set. It’s SO DUMB.

*3:20 Frodo shows the Goddamned Ring to the Goddamned Nazgûl…*  
 If this isn’t proof that Jackson does not understand the story he is supposed to be telling, I don’t know what is. Right here, the movie is over (again). Frodo (now magically atop a tower) shows the Ring to one of the Nine. Sam saves Frodo, Frodo flips out and threatens Sam with Sting, Faramir shoots the fell beast with an arrow, and the Nazgûl **FLIES AWAY?!?**

None of that matters. Sauron now *KNOWS*, not suspects, not fears, but *KNOWS* the Ring is in Osgiliath, being carried by a Hobbit. The rest of the Nine would *instantly* descend on Osgiliath and tear it apart until the Hobbits were found. Even if that somehow failed to happen, it means ~~Gandalf’s~~  Aragorn’s feint at the Black Gates wouldn’t work. Sauron would know the Ring wasn’t with them. This moment completely and irretrievably breaks anything that comes after.

Then, in what I’m certain is a middle finger to people like me, Sam cries, “It’s all wrong! We shouldn’t even be here.”

That’s right, Sam. It is. And you shouldn’t.",Why I Hate the Films: Part II; The Two Towers (Extended),1672643830
lotr,"People in this forum often ask why I dislike the PJ trilogy so much. They assume it’s because things got cut; I get lectured about how you can’t translate an epic like LotR word-for-word, and I understand that. I’m a filmmaker. I never expected we would have Bombadil, or every moment of the trilogy represented.

What I didn’t expect was Jackson’s absolute disdain for the actual soul of the trilogy itself. When I watch these films, I see a lot of great work; the art department, costume department and makeup department obviously wanted to make *Lord of the Rings*, and, largely, they did a fantastic job. 

The script, however, displays obvious contempt for the characters and the world in which they live. At one point, in the Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens audio commentary for *Two Towers,* Boyens says, “Look, our version is just better!”

It's plain that was their attitude about the entire story, and it makes me sad. It makes me angry. Peter Jackson had all the tools at his disposal to do it right, and he pissed it away. No one in my lifetime will have this opportunity again.

I’m not interested in changing anyone’s mind, and you can save your “But dude, Legolas shield-surfing the stairs is AWESOME and I heard the book ends on a total downer!” comments as well. Downvote away. I’m not gonna stop saying the films are terrible, and I honestly don’t care about your arguments to the contrary. This just gives me an easy way to answer *why*. 

I have a lot of issues with the actual filmmaking choices Jackson made; photography, lighting, editing; but that isn’t what this is about. This is about *story*. Frankly, there are a million elements I could tear apart (i.e. *Dayum it’s bright as day in the caverns under the Misty Mountains… no wonder Bilbo found the Ring*), but I’m trying not to be too picky and focus solely on the things that really make me gnash my teeth. By request, here’s a breakdown of what I find so offensive about the Extended Edition of *Fellowship of the Ring…*

*•* *•* *•*

*:03 Elrond in the front lines…*  
 Why is Elrond literally the only warrior in the Last Alliance who couldn’t afford a helmet? This makes me crazy. It’s a little thing but it’s a good indicator of the kind of senseless cheats the next 12 hours are gonna be full of.

*:17 Gandalf prat-falls around Bag End…*  
 Right out of the gate, Jackson begins undermining Gandalf. These aren’t Tolkien’s characters, they are two-dimensional Fantasy Film Archetypes straight from Central Casting. Gandalf has to be a doddering old man because that’s what old men do; they walk into chandeliers and whack their heads on low door frames. Gandalf isn’t a demigod, he’s your absent-minded old uncle. That grinding sound is Tolkien spinning.

*:19 Bilbo hasn’t told Frodo his plan to leave…*  
 The choice for Bilbo to have not revealed his plan to Frodo is very odd. It makes Frodo seem gullible, and it also seems like Bilbo doesn’t trust Frodo, having not taken him into his confidence. It’s just extra story baggage that isn’t really true to the characters.

*:26 Gandalf is surprised by Bilbo’s party trick…*  
 Poor Gandalf. Even though he knows Bilbo better than probably anyone, even though he has plenty of time to see what Bilbo is doing, he is somehow caught unawares by Bilbo putting on the ring. In the book, of course, he adds a flash and bang to make it seem like a trick to mask Bilbo’s vanishing. But poor old movie Gandalf just isn’t that sharp so he sits there like a dunce.

*:27 “What about this ring of yours, is that staying too?”*  
 In the book, it is plain Gandalf approves of the party and the spectacle to make it easier for Bilbo to part with the Ring. That’s the entire plan. For some inexplicable reason, in Jackson’s universe, this is the first time the subject has come up?! So now, in the minute before Bilbo leaves, Gandalf has to browbeat him into parting with the Ring? Why? What narrative purpose does this *possibly* serve other than making Gandalf infinitely less wise than he is in the books? In this version, why wouldn’t Bilbo react as if Gandalf was trying to defraud him?

*:31* *Gandalf almost picks up the Ring…*  
 Had Jackson left the Ring on the floor to be encountered by Frodo when he walked in, it would actually have been a nice, relatively subtle indicator that Gandalf was afraid to touch it. Instead, we get this little waking nightmare with the flash on The Eye. At this point, in Jackson’s world, Gandalf should have no doubt, or, at the very least, much stronger suspicions that this is The One. At this point, it is cruel, criminal and negligent for Gandalf to allow Frodo to take it. But this is doddering Granddad Gandalf, so, of course he just backs away in fear and says “Keep it safe little dude.”

*:37 Gandalf is terrified and scares Frodo to death…*  
 I understand the drive to make the narrative more urgent by drastically condensing the length of time Gandalf is gone from The Shire, and the time Frodo has to plan, but having him return, losing his shit and literally jumping at shadows is just incredibly out of character. 

It also makes it completely irrational for Gandalf to then go off again. If he’s that afraid, he would never leave Frodo and the Ring. He even departs in the same direction as Sam and Frodo, and just abandons them in the forest instead of taking them with him to Rivendell and going from there to see Saruman. In condensing the timeline, Jackson, Boyens and Walsh have completely thrown out the logic.

*:48 Gandalf trusts Saruman…*  
 Oh simple, trusting, doddering Gandalf. In the book, Gandalf *never* trusts Saruman. He only goes to him at Saurman’s request, and even then, gives him no information. In the film, of course, Gandalf lays everything out like a simpleton. Then Saurman REVEALS TO GANDALF THAT HE HAS A PALANTÍR?!? Why would he ever do this? It is an instant admission of guilt and betrayal.

Then we have this stupid, *stupid* wizard battle. Ninety interminable seconds of Old Man WWF that ends with the most ridiculous spun-by-wires scene ever. This is the polar opposite of how magic works in Tolkien’s world. I am embarrassed for this film.

*:53 Frodo finally officially meets Merry &amp; Pippin…*  
 This is a huge thing that most people who love the films simply gloss over, but it changes the tone and tenor of everything that comes after. Before this, we have seen Merry &amp; Pippin precisely twice; once, being idiots stealing a firework to set it off themselves at the party, and again dancing on a table at The Ivy Bush.

Now we meet them stealing vegetables from Farmer Maggot, and Pippin says, “Merry! It’s Frodo Baggins!”

I don’t know why this change made sense to JB&amp;W, but in this version *Merry &amp; Pippin barely know Frodo*. They are, at best, casual, small-town acquaintances. They are absolutely *not* his best and oldest friends. Then, suddenly, they’re all just… together. But there is *absolutely no reason Merry &amp; Pippin would have gone with Frodo*. Yes, they’re mischievous young Hobbits interested in adventure, but this is actual pants-pissing danger. Absent the relationship that’s established in the book, nothing that follows between the four of them makes any sense at all. 

*:57 The Black Rider actually catches them in the forest…*  
 These Black Riders are so much more aggressive and unafraid of anything than they are in the books. One of them has already cut down the gate guard at the Brandywine Bridge in a quick shot. In the book, they are reticent to declare open war on The Shire and the Downlands. They avoid Maggot’s dogs; they attack the Prancing Pony by stealth. These Black Riders would just kill everyone and sift the bodies.

Setting that aside, at this moment, the movie is over. They are actually caught, in the open, by a Rider. Frodo manages to escape, at 3 ½ feet tall, running from a horse. The Rider doesn’t cut them down, doesn’t grab Frodo and pull him over his saddle. He just flails around. This moment is aggressively stupid.

*1:02 Frodo puts on the Ring at the Prancing Pony…*  
 As far as we know, this is the first time Frodo has ever put on the Ring, and instantly, he’s in nightmareland and Sauron INSTANTLY sees him. In the book, the real world fades a bit and hearing is sharpened; had this happened every time Bilbo put on the Ring, obviously, he wouldn’t have used it.

*1:03 Aragorn and Narsil…*  
 Now we’re getting to the point where JB&amp;W have fucked up the opening of the story so much that things are beginning to unravel, and will require a lot of pointless patchwork later on. Aragorn draws a sword here, but it isn’t Narsil. But why would it be? There’s no letter from Gandalf, and Butterbur barely knows him, so there’s no reference to the sword that was broken to give Aragorn his bonafides. 

Frodo simply… takes him at his word, which makes Frodo really dumb. In fact, in this version of the story, there’s no way Aragorn could have known to be looking out for the Hobbits in the first place. Gandalf abandoned them and rode hell-for-leather to Saruman, so who told Aragorn they were coming?

*1:04 The Riders assault on Bree…*  
 And in another Jackson “enhancement,” the Riders literally ride down an entire section of wall, crushing Old Harry underneath. Ahhh, subtlety. But after declaring themselves in this way, they don’t ransack the rest of the inn? They just… leave…?

*1:10 Saruman takes orders from Sauron…*  
 Here we see Saruman getting direct marching orders from Sauron. So we lose all the complexity of Saruman being a competing power and instead he’s simply a minion of Sauron. Makes everything that follows much more two-dimensional, and it’s unfair to Saruman whose arrogance assured him he was in control at all times. Clunky, clumsy, simple-minded.

*1:11 Aragorn hands out blades…*  
 Aragorn hands out four Hobbit-sized blades he just happened to be carrying. So not only did he magically know the Hobbits were coming, he magically knew *how many*, even though there’s no reason in the world Merry &amp; Pippin are still following.

*1:14 Aragorn fucks off and leaves the Hobbits to die…*  
 Everything that could be wrong with this scene is wrong. Aragorn goes to “have a look around,” and can’t be bothered to come back until everything is fucked. They are *supposed* to have a fire. Aragorn builds it in the dell at the top where it won’t be seen from below. The entire space in the film is much too small. 

The description in the books is artful; figures of dread and terror.

“Over the lip of the little dell, on the side away from the hill, they felt, rather than saw, a shadow rise, one shadow or more than one. They strained their eyes, and the shadows seemed to grow. Soon there could be no doubt: three or four tall black figures were standing there on the slope, looking down on them. So black were they that they seemed like black holes in the deep shade behind them. Frodo thought that he heard a faint hiss as of venomous breath and felt a thin piercing chill. Then the shapes slowly advanced.”

In the film four (then five) brightly-lit guys in black cloaks advance to so close to the cowering Hobbits it’s comical. Then, because every non-human in Jackson’s film must be Less Than Aragorn, Frodo just lies back terrified. He doesn’t call out the name of Elbereth (he doesn’t even know any lore, apparently), he doesn’t stab the Witch King, he doesn’t do anything but piss himself. Then, finally, Aragon appears in slow-motion with his generic sword and a torch (lit from what fire? Also, not a brand, and actual *torch*), *sets fire to two of them and actually fences with the others until they fucking flee because he’s just* ***that*** *badass*. Then the INCREDIBLY STUPID torch-throw that ignites the fifth Rider which then flees as well. 

This scene is just so *wrong*, so utterly and completely **not** from Tolkien’s books it would be comical if it wasn’t so painful.

*1:18 Shit-covered Lurtz and the Uruk-Hai*…  
 Yes, the Uruks had been bred to be bigger and less light-sensitive than regular orcs, but this is just absolutely ridiculous. They still only survive by strength in numbers, and trying to make a “super-orc” secondary villain is a cheeseball move.

*1:19 Arwen…*  
 Jesus, this… I get it. There aren’t a lot of women in LotR, and here’s Glorfindel just kinda hanging around not doing anything, so why not replace him? But this meet-cute moment with the sword in the forest, and Aragorn just chewing up the Athelas and mashing it into Frodo’s wound, it’s all so ham-handed. It’s like you told the story to an 8-year-old and then asked him to tell it back to you.

And, of course, because Frodo is just baggage in this movie, he cannot ride alone. He has to ride with Arwen so she can have this “Come and claim him!” moment. But we lose Frodo refusing the summons of the Riders, one of the most important moments of Frodo’s stoicism before reaching Rivendell. Instead, he’s just afraid and useless. 

Then Arwen calls the flood rather than Elrond releasing it, but she does it while they are *still in the water*. And doddering old Gandalf doesn’t even get credit for the horses in the foam.

*1:30 Elrond plots to manipulate Frodo…*  
 Elrond and Gandalf spy on Frodo and Sam, and it is obvious that Elrond expects Frodo to carry the Ring away from Rivendell. Frodo’s single most important moment of agency in the entire story is taken from him. Also, we see that Gandalf somehow recovered his staff from Saruman, but at this point, who cares about continuity?

*1:38 The Council of Idiots…*  
 Ohmigod this scene. What was originally a discussion of events and a council of war debated among the various representatives of the free peoples turns into Boromir almost taking the ring, Gandalf reciting the verse complete with Surround Sound &amp; Lighting Effects, Gimli trying to destroy it with his axe and everyone squabbling like children. 

JB&amp;W took something reasoned and intelligent and made it loud and stupid. I want to punch this scene in the teeth. I’m glad they removed Bilbo, he deserves better. Then they end it by fucking up Frodo’s most important moment so that he has to shout “I will take the Ring!” three times. No, quiet dignity and strength is only for Aragorn, silly Hobbit!

Followed by the awful “My sword! My bow! My axe” scene, because, in this version, they’re just volunteering rather than being chosen. And Merry &amp; Pippin, now **REALLY HERE FOR NO REASON**, declare they will have to be bound in a sack to keep them from going.

Then… oh god, then… they actually wrote down the fucking title and *made Hugo Weaving say it.* “You will be the Fellowship of the Ring!”

*1:52 Gimli suggest going through Moria…*  
 Of all the changes made by JB&amp;W this one confuses me the most. Moria was a huge Dwarven city, Balin decided to retake Moria over thirty years before the Fellowship set out, and he has been presumed dead for decades. There has been no word from Moria, but Gimli seems to think it’s viable and operating. “My cousin Balin would give us a royal welcome.”

Gimli being ignorant of Moria’s status while both Gandalf and Aragorn fear that it is a death trap is a really bizarre story choice. It makes no sense logically, and it doesn’t make any sense structurally. I can’t figure out why they thought this was “better” in any way. Even Saruman (Sauron’s proxy as a villain all through this trilogy) seems to know there’s a Balrog waiting in Moria.

*1:55 Saruman can do anything…*  
 Saruman seems to have no limits in this film. He uses the crows as spies. He controls the weather. He causes a landslide in the pass of Caradhras. He calls lightning from hundreds of leagues away… it’s just too much. This isn’t how magic works in Tolkien’s world, but we’re not in Middle-Earth, we’re in a mediocre D&amp;D adventure where the bad guy knows *everything*. Then Gandalf defers to Frodo, who has no idea what the options are or what they mean. 

*2:02 Gandalf can’t open the doors…*  
 Doddering old Gandalf can’t even come up with the answer. Frodo, the sudden riddle-master (it isn’t a riddle at all, but whatever) has to figure this out? Why did they even bring Gandalf? Once they get in to what is obviously an unlit, disused, long-abandoned entrance, Gimli, who is plainly delusional, says, “Soon, Mr. Elf, you will enjoy the fabled hospitality of the Dwarves. Roaring fires! Malt beer! Red meat off the bone!” It makes NO SENSE.

Imagine having to go through the remains of Fukushima to get somewhere. You know there was an accident, and people went in thirty years ago to do cleanup but there has been zero communication. Why, upon reaching the desolate, abandoned outskirts, would you announce how great it will be?

*2:13 Pippin knocks every piece of metal in Moria down the well…*  
 No scene better illustrates what’s wrong with Jackson’s change in tone than this one. In the book, Pippin, fascinated with the well, drops a pebble down it. After a long fall, there’s a quiet *plunk*, followed long minutes later by the sound of far away drums. It’s an incredibly real moment. A young, impulsive character indulges what seems like a harmless but irresistible whim.

In Jackson’s Bigger, Dumber, Louder, Improved version, Pippin feels an arrow in a body, the head in armor falls off followed by the entire body, a huge iron chain, a ’55 Buick Roadmaster and anything else that could be comically, absurdly loud. At that point, OF COURSE there are drums because it’s a MOVIE MOMENT.

*2:21 Cave-Trolls and Spider-Orcs…*  
 Again, Frodo gets to cower. In the book, he stands side-by-side with Boromir, cries “For the Shire!” and stabs the troll’s foot with Sting, which wounds the troll. Here he runs, cowers, whimpers, makes one lame slash and is hammered by the troll in such a way that, even if the spear didn’t penetrate the Mithril, his innards would be jelly.

Next they run for the bridge and the orcs pour up from the floor and… out of the ceiling? Hundreds of orcs can suddenly defy gravity, crawling like spiders down the pillars, a super-power they have never had before in any version of the stories, and one they never display again. All for a stupid visual.

*2:26 Gandalf holds the bridge against the Balrog…*  
 This sequence makes me angry because it works **so well**, and the reason it works is because it is almost verbatim from the goddamned book! It is proof that, had J,B&amp;M just *trusted* the source material, they would have had a film with so much more depth, power and meaning.

*2:42 The Mirror of Galadriel…*  
 This was when I knew the problems were bigger than I imagined. The removal of Sam, and his vision of Bagshot Row being torn up, was the harbinger of Jackson having removed the Scouring of The Shire. They also fucked up Galadriel’s dialogue for no rational reason; “Things that are yet to come to pass” is a helluva lot less elegant than “Things that yet may be.”

*2:59 Aragorn forgets what movie he is in…*  
 When JB&amp;W threw out the plot point about an eventual choice of whether to go to Mordor, Minas Tirith, or split the Fellowship and take different paths, they apparently didn’t care that they also threw out Boromir’s reason for joining. Had Boromir been told (as he was in this film) that the Fellowship was *never* going to Minas Tirith, he would have ridden home like a good solider to advise Denethor. Instead, he tags along hoping to… what? Wheedle the Ring away from Frodo? Was Boromir instantly ensnared at the Council of the Stupid?

After his confrontation moments earlier in which Aragorn announces he would not bring the Ring within 100 miles of Minas Tirith, that should have been the last straw. Boromir either needs to take it and go, or simply go. But follow he does. When they stop at Parth Galen, *everyone* should have abandoned Aragorn when he forgets what world he’s in and says, “Orcs patrol the eastern shore. We must wait for cover of darkness.”

So… The chief of the Rangers, who has been fighting orcs for 60 years and understands that they are almost completely nocturnal; bred in darkness, hunting and fighting in darkness; and even though there are “new” orcs that move and fight in daylight, they are still *orcs*… this Ranger decides to *wait for the cover of nightfall?!?*

Of course, this is because the writers removed their reason for stopping. There is now no course to be chosen, but they still need Frodo to encounter Boromir alone in the woods. In this version, this valiant band of intrepid heroes simply fail to notice both Frodo and Boromir sneaking away. Apparently, Boromir is the only member of the party with eyes, ears and a brain. 

This moment makes everyone else an idiot. Frodo is an idiot for going off on his own. Sam is an idiot for losing track of Frodo. Aragorn and Legolas are *literally* on the lookout for threats but miss a full-size man in chain mail sneaking away. And Merry, Pippin and Gimli are just idiots most times, full stop.

*3:01 Boromir has Frodo in his grasp…*  
 The Ring makes you invisible, not intangible. Boromir has both hands gripping Frodo’s vest, and yet Frodo puts on the Ring and Boromir somehow… loses his grip? Uhmazing!

*3:03 Frodo gets permission to leave…*  
 This moment. **This fucker right here.** This, more than anything else, displays the actual contempt Jackson, Boyens &amp; Walsh have for Tolkien’s work and his characters. In the book, of course, Frodo realizes the Ring will twist the mind of *anyone* near it and so he must go alone. He makes this decision and goes off, saving only that Sam refuses to be left.

But Jackson’s Frodo is just baggage. He has no agency, gets to make no decisions. He merely bounces and runs from event to event. And Aragorn must be *Our Hero!* He cannot doubt, he cannot be uncertain. Frodo tells him he must go alone and Aragorn consents. He ***CONSENTS???*** 

Aragorn agrees to send Frodo off alone, followed by Gollum, with no map, no guide, and no idea of where he is going. Aragorn thinks this is a ***GOOD IDEA?!?*** 

Never, under any circumstances, would anyone who understood or cared about these characters write this scene. Aragorn’s flaw is his arrogance. He might send everyone else off to Minas Tirith, but he would *never* abandon the Hobbits, confident that her could resist the Ring. (And perhaps he could; he never seemed tempted on the long march to Rivendell, or at any point between there and the Argonath)

**Choose** to send them off **alone?** Go. Fuck. Yourself.

But Jackson’s Aragorn isn’t a person; he’s a Hero. An archetype. He cannot be so easily fooled or have choices taken away from him. He *must* be in command of the non-humans *at all times*. 

This choice by the writers breaks so much of what comes after it can never be fully recovered. The breaking of the Fellowship was supposed to be a chaotic moment of panic followed by an agonizing choice of what to do next. It is the moment when Aragorn truly becomes a leader because he is forced to make a hard choice. Prior to this, he has had Gandalf and Galadriel and the river Anduin to guide him. Under his leadership, everything goes wrong, and that is important. It makes deciphering Frodo’s tracks and choosing to pursue Merry and Pippin *matter*. 

That is too much complexity for Jackson’s Aragorn. No hard choices for him. “Yes, Frodo, you go. I have a huge, overblown action scene to insert myself in! After that, I know *exactly* what to do!”

This is when I actually felt hate for this film. It is unforgivable.

*3:05 Aragorn is INVINCIBLE!*  
 OMG this stupid, stupid fight scene. It’s bad enough that 60+ orcs in full armor (yes, I counted, and that’s just in that shot; seems closer to 100) were able to sneak up on Aragorn in the woods. Then he wades into them and hold his own. Sixty. Uruks. Who, apparently, only have bows when they face Boromir.

And the orcs come within a rat’s ass of catching Frodo; they see him, they chase him; but valiant Merry and Pippin distract the orcs and Frodo the baggage runs away again. Meanwhile, Merry and Pippin stand like the idiots they are while an orc, ordered to bring them in alive, comes at them with an axe and HEEEEERE’S BOROMIR!

Finally Lurtz the super-orc *remembers he has a bow (not that he knows how to draw it)!* And it fires arrows the size of fence posts! Because *of course* it does. All to add a ten-minute-long action sequence that isn’t even in the damned book. 

*3:15 Sam rejoins the movie…*  
 And now, here’s Sam, running back to the boats from wherever the hell he went for the last 12 minutes that he didn’t find a single member of the company or a single orc. In the book, of course, he actually reasons out what Frodo is doing (the only one who does), but that’s far too smart for this hapless version of Sam Gamgee.

All kidding aside, now Jackson has to manufacture a moment of emotion for Frodo leaving. He builds it out of yet one more push in on the Ring in Frodo’s hand followed by voice-over of Frodo and a flashback of Gandalf, and it’s a castle of pure cheese. This would have all happened organically if they had just shot the ending of the book.

This ending also makes Frodo a complete dick. In the book, he is sneaking away with the Ring on, and Sam finds a boat letting itself out into the river. He runs in after and Frodo hopes Sam will give up and go back. This version of the “making the dog leave for its own good” scene is just embarrassing, and because it’s an argument, it makes Frodo seem incredibly callous.

Then Sam drowns. For an hour. 

*3:18 And the rest is loud and stupid…*  
 It’s comedy after this. They send Boromir off in the boat without the weapons of his enemies. Aragorn loots the body, taking Boromir’s bracers for his own, ‘cuz that’s a thing you do to your friends and not out of character at all. Then, they all just watch Sam and Frodo go because this is Aragorn’s *decision*, remember.  

• • •

In the end, the problem is Peter Jackson, Philippa Boyens and Fran Walsh didn’t use the characters from the books. They used the uncomplicated, YA novel versions of them. Generic Old Wizard. Generic Fantasy Hero. Generic Dwarf. Generic Elf. And four Hobbits whom they seem to have forgotten were adults. It’s as if they treated the Hobbits like children because they are the size of children. One might think the men of Rohan wrote this script. 

If you’ve made it this far and think this is out of control, I’ll share that there were around 60 comments I didn’t make, or deleted. And that’s setting aside my issues with the technical filmmaking, which are many. 

Peter Jackson felt he could tell a *better* story than Tolkien. To my eye, all he did was tell a loud, simplistic, stupid version of a similar story.

Their argument was that Tolkien was not consistent with his spellings throughout the years and that the original spelling is not the same as it is today. Sort of a similar situation to how the Bible is a translation of a translation of a translation, so the meanings aren't always the same.

Multiple google searches of the origins of the name and differences between editions/printings brought up no results.

I've always been curious about Gandalf's (or any wizard's) abilities. Thinking back to the movies, every ""magic"" thing I can remember him doing seems to involve one of two things: 

* Talking to animals (Shadowfax, the Eagles, the butterfly that summons the Eagles)

* Creating light with his staff (holding off the Balrog, pushing back the Nazgul, scaring the orcs at Helm's Deep). He also pushed Sarumon out of Theoden's head, which may or may not have been using the staff in the same way, I'm not sure

His other feats, that I can remember, were all related to being really old/wise/respected, not magic.

He can't seem to communicate over a distance or teleport or anything like that, since he always rides a horse when he's in a rush. When fighting in Minas Tirith, he doesn't use any magic, he just fights (awesomely) with his staff as a melee weapon.

I remember Saruman threw a fireball once, but I don't think Gandalf ever did anything like that.

I'm just curious if the White Wizard's magical abilities mostly involve communicating with nature and having a staff that can emit ""good"" or ""holy"" light, or if there's more to it? Maybe he has other powers, but he holds them back in order to allow men/hobbits to reach their full potential, or something like that?",What are Gandalf's powers/abilities?

lotr,"After many hours spent reading and researching all of Tolkien's works, I have finally finished this project which I started over 2 years ago now. In a previous post I linked a spreadsheet containing all population and military size estimates for the 3rd Age. In a series of upcoming posts, I will be explaining my reasoning for each of the numbers starting with the Dwarves:




Blue Mountains: 10,500

 - My first thought when I started with the Blue Mountains Dwarves was that there was no real way of estimating the number of Dwarves that lived there. The only pieces of information that I had to work with were that many Dwarves moved out of the Blue Mountains to Erebor once it had been reclaimed, and that there were 3 of the 7 Dwarf Divisions inhabiting them (before the migration). I started by calculating the army that Dain would've possessed during the Battle of the 5 Armies. Dain brought 500-600 Dwarves to the battle, but likely left a large portion of his army back at home since it was a rushed call to action. He likely ended up only taking about 1/3 of his total military force. Assuming this, he would have 1,500 semi-professional soldiers at his command. Since Dwarves are a much more warlike than the other races of Middle Earth, it is safe to assume that this would make up around 1/8th - 1/9th of the total population of the Iron Hills at the time (this is also based on lower populations usually having larger percentages of their citizens in the fighting force). This would give the Iron Hills a population of 12,500 Longbeards. We can assume that this is roughly half of the Longbeard population, while the other half lived in the Blue Mountains. On top of this, there were the Firebeards and Broadbeams, though they no-doubt have smaller populations than the Longbeards since they had been nearly wiped out previously, as well as the Longbeards being the most predominant of the Dwarf races (likely about 1/5 - 1/4 the total Longbeard population for each race). This would mean that before the migration, the population of the Blue Mountains would've been roughly 18-20,000. With this in mind, we can assume around 1/2 of the total Blue Mountains population left for Erebor once it had been won back. This would leave the population with 10,000, and likely 10,500 by the War of the Ring (dwarves populate slowly, especially in the 3rd Age).

Erebor: 17,500

 - This one, with the above calculations already complete, is much easier to estimate. Assuming that 8-10,000 dwarves migrated from the Blue Mountains to Erebor, as well as a large portion of Dain's people from the Iron Hills (likely about 3/4ths of the 12,500 mentioned above), I estimate there were roughly 17,500 - 20,000 Dwarves residing in Erebor during the War of the Ring.

Iron Hills: 3,500

 - This was also very easy to estimate base on the above calculations. Since there were roughly 12,500 Dwarves living there during the Battle of the 5 Armies, and 3/4ths of them left for Dain's new kingdom in Erebor, we can make an estimation that there were 3,500 dwarves left behind to dwell in the Iron Hills during the War of the Ring (though they were likely called to Erebor to assist Dain in fighting the Easterlings).

Red Mountains: 31,500

 - Obviously, this number could be VERY inaccurate - in-fact, it's possible that there were no Dwarves living in the Red Mountains - but this is my best guess. It is largely accepted that the other 4 Dwarf divisions dwelled in the Red Mountains. Those being the Ironfists, Stiffbeards, Blacklocks, and Stonefoots. My estimation is that each of those races had less than half (for the purpose of the calculation, we'll assume 1/3rd) the population of the Longbeards (which, based on all my calculations above is around 20-25,000). 1/3*4 = 4/3,   4/3*22,500 = 30,000 Dwarves at the time of the Battle of the 5 Armies, and around 31,500 by the War of the Ring. Again, this is completely a guess since we have no real information about these Dwarves.

Other Dwarves: 2,500 - 15,000

 - There were likely other smaller groups of dwarves roaming/living in other mountains scattered across Middle Earth. I have no calculations to back this one up.





Let me know which of these numbers you would change and why. As these figures are not definitive, I am open to changing my numbers if it is for a valid reason.

lotr,"So, I'll start this off by admitting this probably doesn't have a simple answer, and since Tolkien did change his mind on things, from time to time, it might not even just have one, but...

Were the Orcs still Children of Eru? Did He abandon them?

They may, or may not, have once been Elves, twisted by the Dark Powers, but we are led to believe that they weren't made, as they were, by Eru Illuvatar; they were forged of something else by Melkor, who lacked the power to create on his own; only being able to twist what his father had already cast. It wasn't a simple process; fast or kind, and though I guess they could have simply resisted, till the end, and died, being swept back to Eru Illuvatar, at least some of those Morgoth took became Orcs, became loyal to him, and became evil. As they are, few others would show them love, or expect anything of the like from the orcs, in turn, but one might argue that, unlike the Numenorians, who were more simply corrupted of thought by Sauron, and punished for their transgression, the original would-become Orcs may have had no choice, being twisted beneath powers they had no hope of resisting.

And this will get me to Numenor, for a moment. I ALWAYS complain about the fate of Numenor; how an otherwise distant Illuvatar, who didn't step in, and intervene no matter the level of monstrosity was being loosed upon Arda, did his one Sodom and Gamorrah Old Testament moment, and obliterated the island of Numenor, and most of its inhabitants, after having Ar Pharazon, and his Great Armament swallowed up by the lands of Aman, for daring to sail into the Undying Lands. I always complain because it seemed an inflated sentence. He could have still lifted the Undying Lands, made the earth round, and left the Numenorian fleet sailing in circles, until starvation made them return home empty, but He didn't. Part of why this is, in my limited understanding, is that the Valar were forbidden to harm the Children or Eru; Manwe, Aule, Tulkas, and the others couldn't stop the Great Armament from reaching Valinor, and they had to instead beseech Illuvatar to intervene on their behalf, and so He did.

Well, what of the Orcs? Could the Valar harm them, in their many battles of the First Age? I won't bemoan that the Elves, the Dwarves, and the Men fought them; killed them. Had they not, the Orcs would have killed in turn, and they were rather monstrous, by this point, but it gets me back around to the question; were they still Eru's children, whatever their form, or simply fit for conflict, and destruction? Was there some truly twisted thing that Melkor, with his original level of power, as the greatest of the Valar, could do to them that changed them so much Eru would turn His gae away from them, and no longer see them as ""fit for purpose""? When they died, do we believe their souls still travel to Mandos, or were they so broken that they just poofed out of existence? Could they still live forever, if violence didn't find them, or were they rendered ""mortal"" by the machinations of Morgoth? Had He wanted to, and not used up His one intervention on Numenor, could Eru have ""saved"" the Orcs, or were they always intended as such, since none can act save in the will of Eru, and those who struggle to most will simply find they were given His most important parts to play?","Were the Orcs Still ""Children of Eru Illuvatar""?",1672527833

What did you think was going to happen?”


Also, random note:  In the wake of Morgoth’s fall, Sauron was captured by his Eönwë and commanded to return to Valanar for judgement, as Maiar are explicitly forbidding from passing judgement on other Maiar.

So, Gandalf the White, having been returned from death by Eru itself, passes judgment on Saruman, breaking his staff with a word, casting him from the order, and leaving him a mortal (with only the power of his voice left to him).

So, does that mean that Gandalf is no longer a Maiar?  Is he now a Valar?  Is he something in between?

lotr,"I lost my grandpa this year. He was like a second dad to me. And he often did feel more like my dad than my actual father at times when our relationship was strained when I was young (don't worry, me and my dad are closer than ever now). 

If I had to describe him physically, and not just saying he was one of the kindest and gentlest people you could meet: he was tall (6 foot something, taller than my dad), had a big bushy beard as long as I knew him, a very deep voice and he was a lover of nature. I always loved going on walks through the woods with him when I was little (and we came across a bear one time!). Now, who does this sound like? 

For me, it's Treebeard. My grandpa's voice wasn't as deep as his obviously, but all the above attributes, and the fact that he also had a cadence in how he spoke like Treebeard, made me immediately think of him when he came onscreen. And upon this realization is when I started to cry. So much that my roommate heard me and checked on me thinking I was having a breakdown, and I was. 

""Many of these trees were my friends"". That broke me even more, especially knowing that a few years ago a large chunk of woods (the same woods we used to walk together in) near his house were cut down to make way for a strip mall.

And this continues to happen to Frodo throughout the trilogy.

lotr,"Don't want to make this long, but I am curious about your opinion on this topic. The rings of power show obviously was not well received by fans of lotr, especially the books. I'm a filmmaker and I'm starting to think people have a misunderstanding of how to make a successful movie or show, especially in the fantasy genre. 

Fantasy media is a genre that almost requires an expensive budget to make the unbelievable believable. Only animation can achieve a lower budget. That being said you need your movie to be watched by as many people as possible to make your money back. 

I also believe following word-for-word source material is a surefire way to have a box office flop but a great fan score. Not want you want when your budget is hundreds of millions. These movies/shows aren't made for super fans that know the lore, they are made for as many people as possible to enjoy.  

Not sure about this subreddit, but I know there's a huge push against this so-called woke agenda in the media. The introduction of black characters and powerful women seems to rub people the wrong way (among other lore problems). What people don't understand is that it works, that's why Hollywood is doing it. Because that is what the mass audience wants to see, they just don't want an agenda behind it, just let it be. Meaning, let a black character be black, we don't need a monologue about racism in a story where that doesn't exist. House of Dragons did this very well. 

Just curious, do you guys believe an adaptation should be followed word for word despite losing money, or liberties are inevitable so that as many people as possible can enjoy?","In defense of ""The Rings Of Power""",1672437614

I am not. I was talking to a friend, and he mentioned there were flaws, and I said “Yes, but not that many,” and he told me that the biggest one is that there are no women. He felt ashamed when he read an article told him there were no women, and he had loved the book so much, he had never realized that it never featured female characters. I’ve never been bothered by this. I’m a woman. I still grew up with a mind loving fantasies. I still enjoy Tolkien without him adding ladies to every story. Perhaps some would get bored with all the bearded dwarves and such, but I read it like it’s a historical account. It just flows of the page, and I’ll read any fantasy or historical fiction novel with that much ease in writing. I don’t know.

However, in like the second chapter Gandalf also remarks that the ring did not intend to be picked up by hobbits, and that it must be the work of some other force. 

Having read a decent portion of the first book, I’m coming to understand that the world of Middle earth is insanely complex and there is so much shit at play.

lotr,"Something I notice when people talk about lord of the rings films is how the movies skip the fact Gandalf was away for 17 years and by the time Frodo left the shire he was 50, while I get it’s not that big of a deal (and let be honest it wasn’t that important) but let’s consider a few things that could lead to the 17 year time skip

1. Frodo not aging, we already saw this with gollum and Bilbo as both of them got extended lives due to the ring and Bilbo looking around 75 despite being 111, it’s not hard to say the same happened with Frodo and even if it wasn’t life extending magic there’s 50 year olds who still don’t look old, sure there’s Sam, Merry and Pippin who are younger but apart from pippin they would have been in their 20s

2. Barad Dur still being under construction, we see in the film that after Frodo gets the ring, the tower is both still being constructed but also only as far as the hill top, and when they’re at Bree and the forests the tower is completed, but then again these could just be future visions like when Gandalf tried to pick the ring up

Overall it is confusing on whether or not a 17 year time skip did occur or not in the films but in my personal opinion it’s likely a skip did occur but not as long, but overall too I think that the 17 years was not that important to the plot, I get alot of the confusion also is due to Thranduin telling Legolas to find Aragon despite Aragon being like 10 years old but let’s be honest if you take the Hobbit films seriously that was your first mistake",Theory: the 17 year time skip still occurs in the film,1672252011

2.) does numenor not have an army? They make it look like it’s a bunch of ordinary citizens going to protect the queen. Also, they’re all training in the town square like it’s a little show. And to make matters worse….they only use 3 ships?

harrypotter,"While obviously I think her end goal of giving house elves fair working conditions was the right one. She was too self righteous to actually listen to what the elves themselves wanted.

And she's probably right when she says that the elves think that way because they've been conditioned to, but that doesn't change the fact that it's counter intuitive to want to force them to be free. I think that's the point Hagrid and Ron and everyone else is trying to make when they try to talk her out of it. We see that ultimately none of them agree with house elves being mistreated and enslaved, they just don't think Hermione will be able to set them free if they don't want to be free.

She got too greedy with her short and long term goals. Instead of getting them wages her short term goal probably should've been to pass legislation to ensure they're not mistreated, then hopefully elves would start realizing their value and want and seek freedom for themselves, just like it happened with Dobby. We see how fair treatment does so much to improve their lives with Dobby and Kreacher. Her long term goals should've been getting them fair wages, and it's a goal the elves themselves should help her with or want to help her with.

It's an interesting conundrum that shows that the right thing maybe obvious sometimes but that doesn't mean everyone will see that way, and that doesn't mean the solution is equally as obvious.

It is such a ridiculous question and I don't just mean because wizards basically shun anything that is a muggle-specific invention or because they would be able to cast enchantments to protect themselves, but because it takes away from what is supposed to be a magical world. I enjoy Harry Potter because it allows me to escape into another world. Is that world perfect? Of course not. Does it have parallels to the real world? Absolutely.  

But adding guns to that world doesn't add anything to the experience. If anything it takes away from it. The worst curses in the Wizarding Universe can't just be used at will. They require intent (""You have to mean it"") to be effective. So to kill someone, you have to *want* to kill them. To torture someone you have to *want* to cause pain. I think this distinction is important because it provides more insight into the motivations and qualities of the characters. 

Harry tries to torture Bellatrix but his curse isn't successful because he's not the type of person that would want to torture someone. This distinction is what makes the characters in Harry Potter so relatable. We have all had moments where we let ourselves be ruled by our emotions, but we don't act on the thoughts we might have because that's not who we truly are and reason takes over. Adding guns to the equation would eliminate the nuances of the story and make the characters and the world incredibly one dimensional.

After what happened with the Second Wizarding war, perhaps its smart for it to become an option if the Auror chooses, to be trained in the art of firearm usage/safety.  I'm not talking about rifles or shotguns, but concealed handguns.  For the most part, the Auror still acts as an Auror usually does, and still uses magic/wand.

But knowing how to use a handgun efficiently and keeping it hidden from potential enemies, could be beneficial.  From what we know about Dark Wizards, they don't use muggle weapons.  If confronted by a dark wizard, a handgun could be a surprise towards the dark arts user.  Giving the good guys an edge.  Combing the art of wielding magic well with knowledge/wand and the advantages a handgun has.

harrypotter,"People are always on about how the films removed this and cut out that or whatever, and even me included too. I love the books and some scenes deserve to be set in the big screen, but what about things that were never in the books? And was only in the films. Just to clarify, when i mean additions, i don't mean changes. Like the film didn't add harry killing quirrel, they just changed it. And this isn't all of the things they actually added, just some of the worst i believe.

POA is widely considered like the best of the franchise, and i honestly could never see it. At best it's bad and at worst is terrible. But when thinking about it, there's one thing i usually used to overlook, and that is lupin. I never really considered about him that much, but recently i made a post about him, and it got me thinking. Why do they add him talking about lily so much? It makes no sense and it kinda feels like he had a thing for her or something, but why would he? He barely says a word about lily in the books? Comes completely out of nowhere. It's like it's a complete 180 of his character, he loves james simple as that, where was lily? Yeah, nowhere.

HBP is like the complete opposite of POA, everyone pretty much knows it sucks and yeah they're right. This film is complete doo doo. And this one has not just one bad addition but more, and one of them concerns the character of slughorn. And again, his relationship with lily. I don't know why people say they prefer his story about the fish in the film? I never really gelled with it and find it kinda dumb. Like in the books he tells about him what about happened that night his parents died, which is so much more impactful. We rarely get to even really see the truth about what happened his parents died, and in the next book we actually see it happened. And it's a shame, because it feels like it's left forgotten in the films.

But oh know HBP couldn't just help itself, and added an even dumber addition, the burning of the burrow. This one makes like absolutely no sense. Not only is not even canon, not only is it never brought up, not only does it take away one of the best highlights of the book with harry and scrimgeour in the burrow during this time in the book, we also get that stupid scene harry and ginny. It's so baffling and just completely useless. Like the next time we see the burrow, it's completely fine and is never brought up again. It's like you never fred or george be like ''ah man this shit reminds of the time the burrow burned down'' or something like that idk. And also not just that, it looks completely ugly af. The stupid ass shaky cam hurts my eyes so much and gives me chronic diarrhea.

And that brings me to another scene that also has some stupid shaky cam, and isn't in the books, that horrible chase scene in DH part 1. I honestly even forgot about this and wasn't even going to mention it, but that doesn't it mean it can get off scot free. This shit is just so like just dumb. THEY COULD EASILY JUST APPARATE AWAY! AND I CAN'T EVEN SEE WHAT'S GOING ON! AND HOW DO THE SNATCHERS EVEN FIND THEM!? WHAT! I'm sorry, i'm usually not like this when watching films, but this just is just so stupid and makes no sense at all.

And we're still on the same film, because guess what, it even get's worse. That stupid ass dance scene with harry and hermione. And before anyone says this is just some dumb shit between friends, even emma watson said in an interview, she saw this scene as like something that could happen between friends and like they both think they could be something more. And even the next scene hermione and harry look into their eyes lovingly, and even she also says ''what if we just grow old together''. And also the fact that they cut out this line, that pretty much ended the harry/hermione debate and if they would end up together:

*“After you left,” he said in a low voice, grateful for the fact that Ron’s face was hidden, “she cried for a week. Probably longer, only she didn’t want me to see. There were loads of nights when we never even spoke to each other. With you gone . . .” He could not finish; it was only now that Ron was here again that Harry fully realized how much his absence had cost them. “She’s like my sister,” he went on. “I love her like a sister and I reckon she feels the same way about me. It’s always been like that. I thought you knew.”*

I like the song they're dancing to at least, but other than that, that scene is just there to give harmione shippers some a wet dream or whatever. And it even stings ever harder because the scene before this, is quite possibly the worst scene in all of HP canon (not tcc), harry and ron's fight. This shit is so baffling and just downright idiotic. And especially the line, ''your parents are dead! YOU HAVE NO FAMILY!'' Like book ron would never outright or even come close to saying something like that, that shit is on another level of bad. It's just mind boggling the extent that these films would go to antagonize ron and demonize him, they spend all of their stupid ass camping scene montage or whatever, to facilitate that there might be something between harry and hermione and ooh ron's jealous or whatever. It's useless they're just building up for this stupid fight for half the movie and it's just a complete joke. It's like it's memed so much to the point where it really is a joke at this point. I hate this scene with all my heart, and yeah maybe it's a changed scene, but the entire point of the fight is different from the book, and the film just again, makes up some dumbass BS.

That's all i could remember honestly, there might be alot more. Just to be clear, i'm not saying an adaptation shouldn't add nothing or whatever, should stick 100% to it? Nah, where's the fun in that. But just adding dumbass shit and making up complete nonsense like these examples, isn't any better. In my next post i do want to discuss a scene where i think the films do something right, by actually adding something that wasn't in the book.

harrypotter,"Upon a current reread of the series, I find similarities between Harry Potter and Hindu Mythology. At the same time, Rowling pulled elements from the Christian mythos for her books and some from other myths. Some parts of the series speak to me as an Indian reading the series. Let me start with the apparent similarities between the story elements of Harry Potter and famous Indian mythological stories. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Prophecy that Harry must kill Voldemort bares similarities to the story in the Bhagavatam of how an evil king named Kansa received a premonition that the eighth nephew of his would be his killer. While in Harry's case, it was the same except with Voldemort, and how did the two react? 

&amp;#x200B;

Kansa went on a murder spree, killing seven of his nephews before the eighth, a reincarnation of Lord Vishnu himself, and escaped his clutches in the form of Krishna, and Voldemort began targeting the Potters. While in Harry's case, something similar happens when he destroys Voldemort as a baby for the time being, losing his parents in the process. While this is one of the more apparent similarities I have noticed, the trope of a chosen hero or chosen one is quite common in stories.  

&amp;#x200B;

The second thing that struck me was the same scenario in the Mahabharat that led to the death of a famous warrior called Abimanyu was almost the same as the maze in the fourth book. The first is that Harry, like Abimanyu, had to cross a maze to reach the centre of it. In both cases, they found themselves fighting for their lives while no one else could see what was transpiring inside the maze. Finally, both cases ended with some form of tragic circumstances, with Harry's being that he saw Cedric Diggory get killed and Voldemorts return, and Abimanyu lost his life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, Dumbledore's character and Voldemorts resemble the characters of Shakuni and Lord Krishna from the Mahabharata. Especially both are the only ones that can counter the other schemes and plans. Eventually, leading to the death of the other; however, in Dumbledore's case, he dies trying to bring down Voldemort. At the same time, Dumbledore's death and the fall of Bhisma, the grandsire of the dynasty that is the centre of the Mahabharata, are almost the same.

&amp;#x200B;

 Given that many people stop to grieve the loss of both, at the same time, Dumbledore being unable to stop the rise of Voldemort for the second time is an uncanny similarity to how Bhisma was unable to stop the war that is the centrepiece of an Indian epic called the Mahabharata from happening.

&gt;As Dumbledore spoke, Harry heard a rustle behind him and rather‬ thought Kingsley whispered something. He could have sworn too that‬ he felt something brush against his side, a gentle something like a‬ draft or bird wings, but looking down he saw nothing there.‬
…
&gt;‪“Miss Edgecombe,” said Umbridge at once, “tell us how long these‬ ‪meetings have been going on, dear. You can simply nod or shake your‬ ‪head, I’m sure that won’t make the spots worse. Have they been happening regularly over the last six months?”‬ Harry felt a horrible plummeting in his stomach. This was it, they‬ ‪had hit a dead end of solid evidence that not even Dumbledore would be able to shift aside…‬
…
‪&gt;Everyone in the room was gazing at the top of Marietta’s face. Only‬ ‪her eyes were visible between the pulled up robes and her curly fringe.‬ ‪Perhaps it was a trick of the firelight, but her eyes looked oddly blank.‬
‪&gt;And then — to Harry’s utter amazement — Marietta shook her head.‬
‪&gt;Umbridge looked quickly at Fudge and then back at Marietta.‬ ‪“I don’t think you understood the question, did you, dear? I’m asking whether you’ve been going to these meetings for the past six‬ ‪months? You have, haven’t you?”‬
‪&gt;Again, Marietta shook her head.‬
‪“What do you mean by shaking your head, dear?” said Umbridge‬ ‪in a testy voice.‬
&gt;‪“I would have thought her meaning was quite clear,” said Professor‬ ‪McGonagall harshly. “There have been no secret meetings for the past‬ ‪six months. Is that correct, Miss Edgecombe?”‬
‪&gt;Marietta nodded.‬
&gt;‪“But there was a meeting tonight!” said Umbridge furiously.‬ ‪“There was a meeting, Miss Edgecombe, you told me about it, in the‬ ‪Room of Requirement! And Potter was the leader, was he not, Potter‬ ‪organized it, Potter — why are you shaking your head, girl?”‬
&gt;‪“Well, usually when a person shakes their head,” said McGonagall‬ ‪coldly, “they mean ‘no.’ So unless Miss Edgecombe is using a form of‬ ‪sign language as yet unknown to humans—”‬
‪&gt;Professor Umbridge seized Marietta, pulled her around to face her,‬ ‪and began shaking her very hard.‬
…
&gt; ‪Marietta was standing exactly where Umbridge had released her.‬ ‪She seemed neither perturbed by Umbridge’s sudden attack, nor relieved by her release. She was still clutching her robe up to her oddly‬ ‪blank eyes, staring straight ahead of her. A sudden suspicion connected to Kingsley’s whisper and the thing he had felt shoot past him‬ ‪sprang into Harry’s mind.‬

(this is copied and paraphrased a bit from ch27. i hope my mobile formatting is okay.)

now, i always assumed that he’d confunded her. perhaps even obliviated her. but on a recent reread, i realized that a confundus charm’s purpose is to *confuse.* it does not make you do what the caster wants you to or believe what they want you to believe, unless they instruct you verbally perhaps (we never see this happen, but it’s implied by snape in PoA and DH when he uses the confundus as a reason to discredit people that you can use it to convince someone of incorrect information). so why is marietta shaking her head here, rather than agreeing with umbridge? why is she so blank and docile and nonreactive?

harry gets “a suspicion” as to what’s been cast, indicating he finds this behaviour familiar, recognizable. at this point, he has never seen anyone confunded. i checked with potter-search.com and at that point, the confundus has only been referenced: by snape in PoA, and by barty in GoF. the first time we see someone confunded on-page is mclaggen in HBP: he goes “lumbering off in the wrong direction” and is confused and stumbling about knocking into things for the rest of the day. he doesn’t lose awareness. nothing like marietta, who’s not confused at all. she’s calm and cooperative. harry saw plenty of that in “moody’s” defense class in GoF.

Harry potter has some of the best selling books of all time, something like that is hard to compare to, especially when there are hundreds and hundred of other books extremely well made that dont even come close, sure its harry potter and that but when you think of ""harry potter"" you think of Daniel Radcliffe, not harry potters kids, its just become so iconic and well chiseld into our brains a new franchise would be overlooked and wouldnt be able to compare.

My second reasoning is what story would there be to tell, she says its gonna be about the aftermath and people really want to see it but the story kinda ended at that moment, it would be hard to introduce a new villain as there are not really any others mentioned and it wouldnt be very creative, sure there are other worlds in the wizarding universe but why not just make a new story not a hp one.

My last reason is targeted audience, it would be very hard to do as older people or anyone above 10 really would find the original franchise to be to good and nostalgic to be surpassed and the newer generations with the world is advancing would be alot more put off because of jk being transphobic which caused massive backlash

harrypotter,"I don't have a bad opinion of Slytherin house. I can find the given value in every Hogwarts house. In Ravenclaw, for example, knowledge, the desire to know and the love of science. In Hufflepuff, honesty, integrity and honor. In Gryffindor, determination, courage, strength and loyalty. And in the Slytherin house, cunning, ingenuity, ambition, willingness to act and dedication.

I respect all houses equally, but I feel that for some reason the Slytherin house is considered by many people to be the worst and most evil house to belong to. After all, those malicious and evil people who basically do not even deserve the epithet ""human"" end up in this house. Perhaps they are not worthy of being placed in another Hogwarts house based on their own limitations, cowardice, weakness, stupidity and evil and malicious violent, psychopaths behavior. In this way, they spoil the Slytherin reputation and everyone identifies the Slytherin house with these people.

(I have often wondered why there isn't a fifth house, where the useless, incapable of living, or the evil and perverted good-for-nothings are assigned? The name of this house could be MOSGLAMACH. From Old Irish MOSACH; shaggy, rough, bristly bristly, grumpy, surly. And from SGLAMHACH - hungry dog or mastiff - and the animal of the house could be a mad dog with a foaming mouth.)

People with weak abilities, or possibly characterless and infinitely evil people (who are not suitable for any other Hogwarts house due to their inability to live and their inferior character) are just an afterthought.

Apart from them, the Slytherin house could be just as worthy of respect and honor as the other houses. Because not only vile and inferior people came from this house. E.g. Severus Snape - whom I don't think I need to introduce to anyone (I'd rather describe him as a misunderstood, tragic hero), Narcissa Malfoy, who didn't tell Voldemort that Harry Potter was alive, Regulus Black, who was the first to confront Voldemort by stealing his horcrux, or Horace Slughorn - one of my personal favorite characters - who was an extremely utilitarian and calculating man, yet still helped in the fight against Voldemort.

However, there is something about Slytherin house that I still can't wrap my head around to this day. That is, how could a supposedly ""wise wizard"" who is one of the founders of Hogwarts be able to leave a monster for posterity whose task is to destroy innocent children - just because they are ""mudbloods""? I've also read a theory that Salazar did this to protect wizards from traitors who might betray them to the ""muggle inquisitors"" and possibly tell them all the secrets of wizarding society. But I think it's extremely drastic and rude to unleash a Basilisk-level monster on ignorant and innocent children - who know nothing and want no harm. 

This act of Slytherin Salazar basically defined his personality, and it is why everyone considers the Slytherin house to be the most despised house - at least among those who do not belong to it. (E.g.: Everyone at Hogwarts was always cheering against for Slytherin - especially in the Quidditch matches and every Hogwarts houses hated the Slytherin house.) 

The problem is that there is no concrete explanation in the books as to why the founder of the Slytherin house was a potential child killer - which is almost the same level of evil as Voldemort.",What drove Slytherin Salazar to become a child killer and establish Slytherin's bad reputation for generations?,1673538328

Suddenly wheb D comes back, he strips away the feeling of sentimentality and comfort by saying that they are leaving. D's closing remark is that Harry is one of a kind which again makes Horace want to ""collect"" him.

harrypotter,"My girlfriend and I are visiting New York City this weekend and she brought up the idea of seeing grabbing some cheaper last minute tickets to Cursed Child on Broadway. 

A couple years ago I listened to the audiobook of Cursed Child on a long lonely road trip and I honestly didn’t hate it! I didn’t think it was great and had some wtf moments, but as I was driving alone in the dark I was happy to be back in this world. My girlfriend hasn’t read the script or seen the play so everything will be fresh to her. I see it’s now a slimmed down 3 hour show so that has peaked my interest. While it’s hard to find anything positive about Cursed Child on the internet, every review I’ve seen of the stage show has said it’s fantastic, the visuals are stunning and well worth it.

Harry Potter has played a massive role in both our lives and our relationship. I have an extreme case of Dyslexia and the Harry Potter books are what got me to learn to read. As I grew older, Harry learning to cope with his alienation from his peers helped me to cope with the alienation I was feeling. The last couple of years have renewed my interest in the series, turning to the books for solace to help find comfort to confront the adult world. So yes, this series means a lot to me and if this is my one chance to see anything Harry Potter in person, I don’t think it’s something to pass up.

It will also be fitting because I remember I was sitting outside by myself in New York City when I was around 11 or 12 years old when I finished reading Deathly Hallows and was a defining moment of my life. That moment was the first time I really felt myself growing up.

It actually makes more sense for her to take the lead, since Harry's rather shy and unsure of himself, and Ginny has more confidence and experience with dating.

Proof from canon that Ron is a terrible friend.

1. Ron is rude. In Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, when Ron first meets Harry, he asks Harry if he really has the scar and stares at Harry's scar, making Harry uncomfortable.
2. Ron is insensitive. After the Levitation Charm lesson in Sorcerer's Stone, Ron talks mean about Hermione behind her back and makes her go cry in the bathroom. And, no, it wasn't something Ron said to Harry in private, Ron made his mean comments about Hermione in a crowded corridor.
3. Ron approves of murder. In Chamber of Secrets, while discussing why Riddle might have gotten an award for Special Services to the School, Ron says ""maybe he murdered Myrtle, that would have done everyone a favor. So Ron is actually Draco like.
4. Ron has misplaced priorities. In Prisoner of Azkaban, Ron commits the sin of caring more about a pet than a friend. The bottom line is that the falling out between Ron and Hermione in Prisoner of Azkaban is Ron's fault. The reason it is Ron's fault is because of how inappropriately he handled the initial disappearance of Scabbers. Ron was absolutely in the wrong to shake bedsheets in Hermione's face and yell at her in one of the most public settings of Hogwarts, the Gryffindor Common Room. Ron later meanly freezes Hermione out of the food party in the Gryffindor Common Room after their Quidditch win over Ravenclaw. When Harry tries to help Hermione, he yells again and makes poor Hermione run off crying. When confronted by Harry by this, Ron unfairly says ""If she just acted like she was sorry"" The problem with this is that Ron had no right to expect an apology from Hermione for anything unless and until he first apologized to her for shaking bedsheets in her face, yelling at her, and humiliating her in front of the whole common room. Personally, the ONLY way I will EVER apologize to anyone for anything is if the person who feels wronged by me informs me of how they feel they've been wronged by me in a 100% calm, 100% polite, 100% classy, 100% non yelling, and 100% non in your face manner. If someone yells at me, humiliates me, gets in my face, and shakes materials in my face, I will NEVER apologize to them for anything even if it is an indisputable truism that I owe them an apology unless and until they first apologize to me for the yelling, humiliation, in your faceness, etc. Bare in mind that being humiliated is a MUCH worse position to be in than the position Ron was in. Then, later on, Ron won't listen to Hagrid when Hagrid gives his correct perspective that Ron should value his friend more than rats. Remember: FRIENDS SHOULD ALWAYS BE VALUED ABOVE PETS! NO EXCEPTIONS!. Even minor level friendships such as Harry Potter and Katie Bell should always be valued above pets. Harry should care MUCH more about Katie than about Hedwig. Since Ron and Hermione are actually close friends, it's MUCH more true that Ron should care far more about Hermione than about Scabbers. The caveat is this: If Ron would have approached Hermione in a classy and polite manner and informed her of what he thought had happened and what his evidence was in a classy and polite manner, he would then have been justified in expecting an apology from Hermione. Here's what Ron should have done: He should have left the bedsheets in the dorm, calmly approached Hermione in the common room, and asked her for a word. He should then have asked her to follow him up to his dorm and talked to her in private. He then should have showed Hermione the bedsheets and cat hairs and explained that Scabbers was gone and that the evidence pointed to Crookshanks eating Scabbers without yelling. Had Ron handled the situation this way and Hermione still completely denied that the evidence pointed to Crookshanks eating Scabbers, Ron would have been MUCH more justified in becoming angry with Hermione after that. But, Ron needed to understand that no one is going to apologize for anything if you yell at them, humiliate them, or shake materials in their face. Acting like that is only going to rile people up and make people angry and defensive. Being yelled at will also freak most people out. While ""friends should always be valued above pets"" is a hill I will forever die on, I would have MUCH more respect for the opinion that Hermione should have apologized to Ron if Ron himself had handled himself in a classy manner like he should have.
5. Ron is untrusting. Ron falls out with Harry in Goblet of Fire because he doesn't doesn't trust Harry enough. After knowing him for three plus years, Ron should know Harry well enough both to know that he would never have put his own name in the Goblet of Fire knowing the extra attention that would bring as Harry hated fame and attention AND that Harry would NEVER go behind his back or exclude him. Ron knows Harry well enough that he should have trusted Harry and not been suspicious of him. If I were Harry Potter, I would never have forgiven Ron for this betrayal and would never have had anything to do with him ever again. After the 1st Task, Harry should have removed Ron from his life and fully embraced his friendship with Hermione, who proved through her loyalty and support after Harry's name came out of the Goblet of Fire that she and not Ron was Harry's true Bestie. If Harry needed more than one best friend he should have become closer with Neville, Ginny, or Luna. Always remember that it is an indisputable truism that Ron was 1000% unjustified in not supporting, not believing, and not trusting Harry here. Always remember that it is an indisputable truism that this falling out was 100% Ron's fault and 0% Harry's fault. Harry literally didn't do anything wrong and Ron had NO legitimate justification for not supporting, believing, and trusting Harry more here.
6. In Order of the Phoenix, Ron is rude to first years in his prefect duty and calls them midgets.
7. In Half Blood Prince, Ron rudely takes an armchair by fire from an innocent first year. (Hermione does the right thing and gives the armchair back to the first year.)
8. Ron is observed to be unkind by Luna. On page 310 of Half Blood Prince, Luna says that Ron is unkind and that she had noticed that last year. Consider the fact that lovely and awesome Luna feels no affection for Ron and thinks him unkind.
9. In Half Blood Prince, Ron is mean to his Quidditch teammates and makes Demzela cry.
10. The worst part of all: Ron is disloyal. Ron literally betrayed and abandoned both Harry and Hermione on the road in the middle of a WAR. When you betray and abandon your two best friends on the road in the middle of a WAR, then you are NOT loyal but are a fair weather friend. You can't blame the Horcrux because both Harry and Hermione were it is well and neither of them ever abandoned each other or the mission. You also can't blame hunger. Neither Harry nor Hermione had any more to eat than Ron did. You can't blame conditions either. Harry and Hermione didn't have any comfortable beds or anything any more than Ron did. Even in general, Harry and Hermione had better attitudes toward the Horcrux Hunt than Ron and both did far less worrying and whining than Ron did. Harry was right on the money when he said that Ron knew he signed up for. Ron knew that the Horcrux Hunt wasn't going to be flowers and chocolates. This was the moment that made Ron 1000% irredeemable and proved for good that Hermione and not Ron was Harry's true Bestie and truly loyal friend. Ron literally betrayed and abandoned both Harry and Hermione on the road in the middle of a WAR. When the going got tough, Ron got going and ditched his friends. That's a fair weather friend for you.

So you know how in the Prisoner of Azkaban movie (especially the first dementor scene on the train to Hogwarts) the screen effect symbolizing the dementor stealing the soul of a person?

On the other hand, Sirius laying by the lake at the end of the movie and the soul-mass(?) temporarily exiting/reentering his body was absolutely fantastic. I just really didn't care for the blurry screen effect; it just doesn't seem like the right way to animate it to me.  However, at the same time, I'm not the type of person to ordinarily complain without trying to come up with a better solution and honestly nothing immediately occurs to me as a better portrayal method.

I know that book vs. movie discussion threads are extremely common, and one thing I have noticed is that a lot of people will also discuss how the changes that were made to the movies affected how they felt about a particular character's death as opposed to how they felt when they read the books.  Now, while many people have expressed that the movies lessened the impact of some characters' deaths for them, I am wondering if there are any instances where the movies might have heightened the impact of a character's death.

Personally, I noticed that Hedwig's death actually hit me harder when I watched *Deathly Hallows: Part 1* as opposed to when I read her death in the book.  There's just something about my favorite Snowy Owl's dying while actively trying to protect Harry (movie death) as opposed to dying while sitting in a cage (book death) that caused me to lose more tears while watching the movie versus while reading the book.

harrypotter,"During the scenes going back to the Triwizard Tournament, it cuts to the Ludo Bagman commentary that was happening in the background of Goblet of Fire. In that, we get this:

&gt;If you’re from Hogwarts. Give me a cheer.

&gt;*There’s a loud cheer*

&gt;If you’re from Durmstrang — give me a cheer

&gt;*There’s a loud cheer*

&gt;AND IF YOU’RE FROM BEAUXBATONS GIVE ME A CHEER

&gt;*There’s a slightly limp cheer*

I’m unsure whether it was just an abysmal attempt at humour in Fleur doing poorest in the tasks, or if the writers genuinely thought there were less people there from Beaxbatons. 

Just to give perspective, Beaxbatons is stated to have a far bigger castle than both Hogwarts and Durmstrang. While some of that might just be for show, you have to take into consideration that ,unlike Hogwarts, Beaxbaton’s general population isn’t only from one country as they house wizards from numerous Central European countries surrounding France. 

Granted, I imagine it’s similar with Durmstrang, but they certainly wouldn’t give off a “limp cheer”.

For one, did Barty Crouch Jr actually need to continue taking Moody’s hair? Couldn’t he have used his own while he was Moody? Technically they should have the same DNA.

Another thing, polyjuice potion should be the most contamination crazy potion to make. Do you know how much DNA humans and animals leave behind in their environments.

harrypotter,"A lot of people like to criticize Yates for his work but I personally thought he was one of the better directors for Potter. Im speaking about only his 4 Potter films as I think the FB films weren’t consistent or coherent enough as a story. 

When I look at Yates’s work, I think of camera moving and imagery storytelling. His films, outside of Alfonso Cuaron, felt the most cinematic and emotional of any in the series. In most of his films, he gets great performances from the actors and always has this gritty tone to the films that were needed for the back half of the series. His adaptations were decent but I attribute that to the lack of runtime in the film(s). Him and Steve Kloves had great chemistry together in my opinion. 

If David Yates was around given the option to direct Goblet of Fire, a far better narrative than Order of Phoenix imo, I’m sure we would’ve gotten a more darker and tonally consistent film that Newell’s Goblet of Fire. 

•The Death eater attack would’ve been a little longer. 

•The Dragon chase would be significantly toned down or removed 

•The 3rd task would’ve included more creatures and jump scares for the audience.

And I'm assuming she was in classrooms with other students and teachers. So she was clearly seen a lot, right?

And also, Hermione argues that Harry can't run in and get Scabbers in Hagrid's hut, as past Harry seeing himself, would think that he was going mad, or that some dark magic was going on. She even says, that there are stories about wizards seeing themselves, and killing themselves. But again, if Hermione went in, and explained the situation, primarily to herself, surely that would be problem solved?

I see so many posts of people saying that they go back to the movies to feel good, to feel at home, to be comforted. I don't feel that way.

I need at least a year between two watches of the series. For instance, last time I finished a HP movie marathon was 2 months ago and yesterday I went back to the sorcerer's stone and got bored very soon. I forced myself and kept watching till the ""you're a wizard, harry"" scene and then I just had to stop.

Personally, I think Warner should do what they seem to be already testing with Hogwarts Legacy: use Hogwarts, but in a different context. If Hogwarts Legacy works, I can see them creating a TV series taking place in Hogwarts, possibly also taking place in a different time period. Maybe the first season could be during Hogwarts's foundation and start from there, with the founders, as the heads of their respective houses, helping Hogwarts studying deal with their struggles, while also dealing with their own struggles.

They could just call it ""Hogwarts"", or, if they want to make the fandom happier, maybe they could call it ""Hogwarts: A History"".

harrypotter,"11 January 2023 - In recent years, the wizarding world has seen a steady increase in international trade and commerce, but sources now suggest that this trend is slowing down.

The Ministry of Magic has reported a decrease in the number of import and export licenses issued for wizarding goods and services, indicating a downturn in international trade. This has caused concern among many in the wizarding community, as international trade has become a crucial aspect of the wizarding economy.

Businesses that rely heavily on international trade, such as the magical instrument industry and the potion-making industry, have reported a significant drop in profits. Many merchants have been forced to lay off workers and reduce production as a result of the decrease in demand for their products.

Experts attribute the slowdown in international trade to several factors, including increasing regulations and tariffs imposed by the Ministry of Magic, as well as tensions between different wizarding nations. Some have also pointed to the ongoing war in the Middle East, which has affected trade routes and made it more difficult for merchants to transport goods.

The Ministry of Magic has assured the wizarding community that they are taking steps to address the issue, but many businesses and individuals are calling for more drastic measures to be taken to boost international trade.

One even stretched it way too far and said:

In Philosopher’s Stone, Harry faces the book’s challenge with Ron and Hermione; all of his friend’s support. In Chamber of Secrets, Harry faces the challenge with Ron only, having to leave Hermione behind. In a similar fashion, in Prisoner of Askaban, Harry has to face the book’s challenge with only Hermione, having to leave Ron behind. And finally, in Goblet of Fire, Harry faces the challenge completely alone; showing the growth Harry had to go through from  books 1-4. I think also, and this really is my own theory of Rowling’s intentions, that she wanted to show that end to end, Harry had to face Voldemort alone with his own bravery.

harrypotter,"It's pretty common to talk about how Voldemort has chopped up his soul into a bunch of tiny pieces, and how little he would have left- but I think people have missed quite how bad it is.

As I'm sure many remember, you don't just split your soul when you make a Horcrux- you split it when you murder someone in cold blood, as Slughorn tells Riddle here:

&gt;By an act of evil — the supreme act of evil. By committing murder.  
&gt;  
&gt;Killing rips the soul apart. The wizard intent upon creating a Horcrux would  
&gt;  
&gt;use the damage to his advantage: He would encase the torn portion —”

If we take that entirely at face value, things aren't looking very good for Tom's soul. 

Looking at the number of Inferi in the lake, then let's take 150 as the minimum he killed and 1000 as the maximum. Seems about fair. Then, *at best*, he'll have 151-1001 individual pieces of soul. But it's not quite so simple.

In order to find our real answer, we have to decide how a soul tears (though, in sincerity, I *soul-*ly doubt it's meant to be treated so mathematically). Since there's no way with each given murder to know the total number of murders in the future, there's no reason to split an even piece of each time. So likely no perfect 151-1001 part soul. 

If, each time, a chunk just comes off like a sandwich crumb, then he's probably got a bunch of tiny super mini soul bits floating about. Great to resurrect yourself with those.

But. If it's actually cutting off a half each time, and assuming that each half won't be spared future halving in the future, then after 150 murders he'll have 2\^150,  or seventy quattuordecillion (!!!), individual pieces of soul. 7•10\^46. And if it's 1000 murders, then it'll be in almost a centillion, or \~9•10\^302 different parts. Soooooooo yeah. Big numbers. Very big numbers.

That does seem to explain why his soul was so unstable he made a whole accidental Horcrux.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Some alternate scenarios: 

* Voldemort loses a half each time he makes a Horcrux, but murder alone doesn't split his soul in two. Then, he's only got 1/256th remaining.
* Voldemort plans ahead and manages to put about 1/7th in each intentional Horcrux. He still probably ends up splitting the final seventh with Harry, since he gave it up by accident, meaning he and Harry each get 1/14th.
* Peter Pettigrew, when resurrecting him, draws some substantial fraction off of all the Horcruxes, giving him actually a decent restart point.
* Voldemort's soul is no longer a single entity but a sickly buzzing hive of barely connected parts, which no horrible act is even able to damage more.

harrypotter,"Dobby, is practically everyone's favorite character, yet he really gets the short end of the stick in the films. It's like so annoying, and the real reason i could see why they cut him out of the following films we'll discuss, is because they really didn't know any better, or better yet didn't know he would become such a huge and important character later down the line. But is that actually true? By the time the GOF film came out, it was 2005, and the GOF, OOTP, and HBP book already released, and dobby is a prominent character there as well. And when 2007 came about, the books ended and only the OOTP film came out, so why couldn't they have included him in the films before? Is it because they think he's some useless character or something? It's stupid. 

**The Chamber Of Secrets**

Yes, his first appearance to the franchise, really doesn't stick out much. He really just like barely shows up in the film, just in the beginning, middle, and end. Not really much to say here, because even in the book like what does he do? The only thing that really sticks out, is his love of harry tbh. He's so devoted and loyal to him even though he's not even his master, they honestly seem like really good friends, but none of that is really translated in the films tbh. Harry just seems like he doesn't give 2 shits about dobby, and ofc this will become much more apparent later, but even here it feels hfbr3bf yk. 

I also want to talk about his design, and yeah it looks...ugly af. Like i get he's a house elf what more was i expecting, but his design just looks like a wrinkled nutsack tbh. And it's shame they don't have his round glassy tennis ball eyes or whatever. 

Lucius pretty much kills harry and the end of the film, and this is the last we see of dobby, until his eventual demise, but i don't care because he still shows up in the books.

**The Goblet Of Fire**

I remember a while back of something i saw on youtube i think, but it was an easter egg of the GOF film, and in a split second shot you could make it out dobby and winky, during the quidditch world cup scene. And it just makes it even worse why they didn't show up. And i think maybe that's why they didn't want to add dobby? Because they didn't want to have winky? Or something idk i'm really grasping at straws. And it's even more baffling because winky is a great character. Yeah, sure she's an alcoholic mess, but she's really like the driving force for hermione's S.P.E.W obsession and movement. And this scene really shows it.

 *“You may rest assured that she will be punished,” Mr. Crouch added coldly. “M-m-master . . .” Winky stammered, looking up at Mr. Crouch, her eyes brimming with tears. “M-m-master, p-p-please . . .” Mr. Crouch stared back, his face somehow sharpened, each line upon it more deeply etched. There was no pity in his gaze. “Winky has behaved tonight in a manner I would not have believed possible,” he said slowly. “I told her to remain in the tent. I told her to stay there while I went to sort out the trouble. And I find that she disobeyed me. This means clothes.” “No!” shrieked Winky, prostrating herself at Mr. Crouch’s feet. “No, master! Not clothes, not clothes!” Harry knew that the only way to turn a house-elf free was to present it with proper garments. It was pitiful to see the way Winky clutched at her tea towel as she sobbed over Mr. Crouch’s feet. “But she was frightened!” Hermione burst out angrily, glaring at Mr. Crouch. “Your elf ’s scared of heights, and those wizards in masks were levitating people! You can’t blame her for wanting to get out of their way!” Mr. Crouch took a step backward, freeing himself from contact with the elf, whom he was surveying as though she were something filthy and rotten that was contaminating his over-shined shoes. “I have no use for a house-elf who disobeys me,” he said coldly, looking over at Hermione. “I have no use for a servant who forgets what is due to her master, and to her master’s reputation.”*  

She plays such a huge part in the whole crouch storyline, which IMO is really where this book shines. And yes ik this is about dobby, but it feels weird to not at least mention her, because then again, it was because of him she even got a job. But in this book we really see the relationship of him and harry building stronger, especially with the gillyweed.

Okay listen...i get why they cut out him actually giving it, and having neville do it instead, because it made more sense...but it's not like the films made that shit up. That was his original plan in the first place, he wanted harry to ask neville about gillyweed but that failed so he used dobby instead...so why couldn't they just do that instead too? It's like it's the little things that make harry and dobby special yk, even him giving him the stupid sweater he made for him, that's just cute. And even just the fact that again he risked his neck just to help harry, is even better. 

**The Order Of The Phoenix**

Okay replacing dobby with neville last time you had a pass, doing it again nah that's taking it too far. It's like why? Just why? It's so stupid and leaves dobby doing nothing and not even show up in the entire film. And not even just the fact that he doesn't find the room of requirement, nah they take it a step further, and not have him warn harry about umbridge.

 *But he thought he knew — surely only one “she” could induce such fear in Dobby? The elf looked up at him, slightly cross-eyed, and mouthed wordlessly. “Umbridge?” asked Harry, horrified. Dobby nodded, then tried to bang his head off Harry’s knees; Harry held him at bay. “What about her? Dobby — she hasn’t found out about this — about us — about the D.A.?” He read the answer in the elf’s stricken face. His hands held fast by Harry, the elf tried to kick himself and fell to the floor. “Is she coming?” Harry asked quietly. Dobby let out a howl, and began beating his bare feet hard on the floor. “Yes, Harry Potter, yes!” Harry straightened up and looked around at the motionless, terrified people gazing at the thrashing elf. “WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?” Harry bellowed. “RUN!” They all pelted toward the exit at once, forming a scrum at the door, then people burst through; Harry could hear them sprinting along the corridors and hoped they had the sense not to try and make it all the way to their dormitories. It was only ten to nine, if they just took refuge in the library or the Owlery, which were both nearer — “Harry, come on!” shrieked Hermione from the center of the knot of people now fighting to get out. He scooped up Dobby, who was still attempting to do himself serious injury, and ran with the elf in his arms to join the back of the queue. “Dobby — this is an order — get back down to the kitchen with the other elves, and if she asks you whether you warned me, lie and say no!” said Harry. “And I forbid you to hurt yourself!” he added, dropping the elf as he made it over the threshold at last and slamming the door behind him. “Thank you, Harry Potter!” squeaked Dobby, and he streaked off.*  

This is even dumber because now in the film, the entire D.A gets in trouble, whereas in the book they all got off totally unharmed. Which even brings us to very next scene in the film, where they're in dumbledore's office and completely ruin that too. I'm sorry, i'm getting off track the OOTP film is the bane of my existence, and it ruined dobby so it's even worse now.

But oh wait, like GOF this film could't get enough of ruining just one house elf, so they ruined another one...kreacher. I love the fact that harry actually goes to kreacher and asks him if sirius betrayed him, and he doesn't look like a complete idiot for not actually going to check...UNLIKE IN THE FILM! WHERE HE IS. Kreacher is like the complete opposite of dobby, having no respect sirius and pretty much hating his guts. And i understand, he really was the living embodiment of everything he hated with his family's pureblood mania. And even his betrayal is such a crazy ass plot twist, and makes sirius dying even so much more gut-wrenching. And i know this about dobby, but it plays in here too, by removing the character it makes their death much less impactful. Hence, dobby in DH. His death feels unearned and downright cheap and pretty much useless, because all that build-up we had of him and harry's friendship growing and growing over the course of the series, is just completely gone. And at times it also makes him an idiot, like not asking kreacher in the fire about sirius in the film AND...

**The Half-Blood Prince**

Not telling dobby to spy on malfoy. It's literally right there dude, you're so close. Yes, it's not established he even works in hogwarts, but guess what aberforth still called him in malfoy manor, so idk. And i find it hilarious that this homeboy really beat the living hell out of kreacher, and broke some of his teeth because he was talking shit about harry, that's just dedication. 

And that's pretty much all he does for this book...so maybe i'll be lenient and i'll give the film a pass for him cutting him here.

**The Deathly Hallows**

But now reach the penultimate end of whatever idk. Because the films pull a complete 180 and actually include him in the film...YAY but not really. It just feels really rushed and like they're trying to cram in all the missed character moments we had from the books all into 1 scene and it just fails completely, rendering his death scene just completely butchered.

This is honestly one of the best death scenes of the entire series, and it's done beautifully in the book.

 *“Dobby — no — HELP!” Harry bellowed toward the cottage, toward the people moving there. “HELP!”  He did not know or care whether they were wizards or Muggles, friends or foes; all he cared about was that a dark stain was spreading across Dobby’s front, and that he had stretched out his thin arms to Harry with a look of supplication. Harry caught him and laid him sideways on the cool grass. “Dobby, no, don’t die, don’t die —” The elf’s eyes found him, and his lips trembled with the effort to form words. “Harry . . . Potter . . .” And then with a little shudder the elf became quite still, and his eyes were nothing more than great glassy orbs, sprinkled with light from the stars they could not see.* 

Deathly hallows is already a complete bonkers book, with deaths flying left and right and centre, yet dobby's one really just feels like it came out of nowhere and unexpected, and that really adds to the scene rather than take away. I still remember reading the book for one of the first times, and his death really hit me super hard. Like i was literally bawling my eyes out damn. And what's even sadder than him just dying is the scene with his funeral. “

*''There,” she said softly. “Now he could be sleeping.” Harry placed the elf into the grave, arranged his tiny limbs so that he might have been resting, then climbed out and gazed for the last time upon the little body. He forced himself not to break down as he remembered Dumbledore’s funeral, and the rows and rows of golden chairs, and the Minister of Magic in the front row, the recitation of Dumbledore’s achievements, the stateliness of the white marble tomb. He felt that Dobby deserved just as grand a funeral, and yet here the elf lay between bushes in a roughly dug hole. “I think we ought to say something,” piped up Luna. “I’ll go first, shall I?” And as everybody looked at her, she addressed the dead elf at the bottom of the grave. “Thank you so much, Dobby, for rescuing me from that cellar. It’s so unfair that you had to die, when you were so good and brave. I’ll always remember what you did for us. I hope you’re happy now.” She turned and looked expectantly at Ron, who cleared his throat and said in a thick voice, “Yeah . . . thanks, Dobby.” “Thanks,” muttered Dean. Harry swallowed. “Good-bye, Dobby,” he said. It was all he could manage, but Luna had said it all for him. Bill raised his wand, and the pile of earth beside the grave rose up into the air and fell neatly upon it, a small, reddish mound. “D’you mind if I stay here a moment?” he asked the others. They murmured words he did not catch; he felt gentle pats upon his back, and then they all traipsed back toward the cottage, leaving Harry alone beside the elf. He looked around: There were a number of large white stones, smoothed by the sea, marking the edge of the flower beds. He picked up one of the largest and laid it, pillowlike, over the place where Dobby’s head now rested. He then felt in his pocket for a wand. There were two in there. He had forgotten, lost track; he could not now remember whose wands these were; he seemed to remember wrenching them out of someone’s hand. He selected the shorter of the two, which felt friendlier in his hand, and pointed it at the rock. Slowly, under his murmured instruction, deep cuts appeared upon the rock’s surface. He knew that Hermione could have done it more neatly, and probably more quickly, but he wanted to mark the spot as he had wanted to dig the grave. When Harry stood up again, the stone read:* ***HERE LIES DOBBY, A FREE ELF.***  

Just the fact that he thought dobby deserved just as a grand funeral as dumbledore, really speaks to what i've been talking about this entire post, their friendship. That's what really matters, and that magic is really completely lost in the films. Even his last words don't feel earned at all in the films. In the books it's simple, it's just ''harry potter'', because that's all he needed to say, his actions spoke louder. Like him saving harry with the gillyweed, his present with the baubles he presented in the ROR, his crazy ass sweater he gave harry, warning him about umbridge, and even beating up kreacher because he talked shit about his boy, that's dobby, and all of that is lost in the films, and makes his death way less impactful. Both DH films always felt weird to me, in ways i couldn't really articulate, everything just felt, like less impactful and especially the death's. And i now i know why, it's not built up or set up. And that's the problem, you don't build off characters to just have them to die, you develop them first and then kill them, but it just felt the filmakers went the opposite way, and had the intent to kill him first, and didn't care about developing him because they just thought they were going to die in the end, so who cares. It's that level of carelessness that really shows in character's like dobby. And this happens all the time, just read this post again and replace dobby with sirius and it would pretty much be the same, or maybe even lupin too. But for now, it's dobby's turn for the spotlight. 

**In Conclusion**

I always feel like nobody really cared about dobby in the films tbh, like the only time he's actually mentioned is just like how it's better than neville gave him the gillyweed or whatever. But i feel like even in the films too, they really just didn't care about him. And it's not like he's some underrated nothing character, no he's prominent enough to get killed off spectacularly and plays major roles in the last few books. He doesn't get the respect he really deserves man, he honestly deserved so much better. And kreacher too man my god, how come he didn't show up in the end of the battle of hogwarts, such a missed opportunity. But then again, pretty much everything that has to do with dobby is a missed opportunity in the films. Also people who say kreacher had a better character arc than dobby? Like what was dobby's character arc? Huh? He loved harry through and through and really didn't change that much as a character. Whereas kreacher actually changed drastically and went from just hating harry's guts to serving faithfully and lovingly. Not really even related that much, but i just like it had to be said.",Dobby Really Deserved Better In The Films.,1673391091

harrypotter,"Don’t get me wrong all three were very good and solidified how I imagined the book versions of their characters going forward but which one fit their part most? 

I think it comes down to who your favorite character is. For me i thought Rupert Grint was the best cast. 

I thought he was the best of the three in the first couple of movies (“why can’t we follow the butterflies?” cracks me up) and starting with PoA it was about even. Ron was dealt dirty in the movies though and I attribute this to the scriptwriter. 

Harry i think is pretty close to the book version minus the sarcastic quips that were in the book.  We kind of got this in in Half Blood Prince with the Felix Felicis sequence but overall he’s more of a straight man, stereotypical hero character.

For Hermione I think the issue is that the movies made her feel more like Harry’s best friend than Ron did, which again I attribute to the scriptwriter. She also comes across to me as more bossy in the movies than in the books and I don’t know if it’s due to the script or Emma Watson’s direction.

harrypotter,"It's not exactly a secret that Warner Bros has seen better days. Amid a series of massive corporate reshufflings, and a string of unexpected box office flops, WB has made some HUGE decisions in the last year or so. 

While most of the attention has been put on DC, the Wizarding World franchise has also gone through some changes. Most namely, the cancellation of the Fantastic Beasts franchise. Secrets of Dumbledore is at least for now, the last Wizarding World movie, with the last two Fantastic Beasts movies no longer in production. 

However, this begs the question: What can WB do to make this a profitable film franchise again? Well, here is how I think they should go about it. 

**Albus Potter and the Cursed Child**

Now it's not exactly a secret that this project has been in consideration for some time now, however I think it would be the best direction to go. At least for right now. 

While the play was not very good at all (at least IMO), I think that a movie could fix some of the problems. 

I'd go with an entirely new villain, who isn't related to Voldemort or Bellatrix. Someone looking to maybe take the best aspects of Grindelwald and Voldemort and try to accomplish what they couldn't. Maybe, this new villain could be the same age as Albus and Scorpius, allowing for a new dynamic that we haven't seen before. A Wizarding World villain that's the same age as the main characters. 

I would most likely eliminate the time travel plotline, since I think that the time-turners should remain a rare item that's almost never seen. Maybe this idea could be explored in the future, but for a first movie, it's just not a good idea at all. 

Also, this is a no-brainer for me, but I'd bring back the original actors from the first 8 films to play their older selves. And yes, this does include Emma Watson, since it wouldn't make sense for Hermione to be a different race in this franchise. 

This could be the first in a new series of films, or it could be a one-and-done. But after the Fantastic Beasts franchise failed to appeal to casual audiences (and even hardcore fans), I think a big title like this would be the best way to bring attention back to this franchise. Just do what Disney did with Star Wars but do it better than they did. 

**The Marauders**

I'd make this the first TV show of the franchise, following a young James Potter, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew, and their various misadventures at Hogwarts. We could also see a lot of other younger versions of characters, such as Snape, Lily, Lucius, Bellatrix, Narcissa and Regulus. Not to mention all of the professors. 

This could be a much lower stakes show, simply focusing on relationship drama, teen angst and anxiety, and the meaning of friendship. However, we could also see the beginning of the Death Eaters and see a transition into the first Wizarding War against Voldemort. Ideally, I'd have the show end with Voldemort being defeated in Godric's Hollow, Lily and James being killed and Sirius being arrested. 

**The Founders**

This would either be a movie or a mini-series, and would follow the four founders of Hogwarts, and their early struggles with running the school. We'd see how they all first came together, how various aspects of the school were decided, and the eventual falling out between Salazar Slytherin and the rest of the founders. 

If this movie/series is a success, then I would leverage the popularity of it, to make a sequel based on the founding of Ilvermorny in America. I don't think it would be fair to completely ditch the American side of this world, just because of Fantastic Beasts' failure. Speaking of:

**Dumbledore and Grindelwald**

This trilogy would COMPLETELY retcon the Fantastic Beasts' trilogy out of existence and give us the version of this story that we should've gotten in the first place. We get to see Dumbledore's tough upbringing, his relationship/friendship with Grindelwald, and the eventual duel between them and Aberforth that would cost Aurelia her life. 

The second movie would be about Albus travelling the world and making a name for himself, eschewing the naive and bitter personality he would've had in the first film. Grindelwald would meanwhile be building his own band of supporters.

The third film would finally see the famous duel between the pair, ending with Dumbledore detaining his former love and sending him to Azkaban where Voldemort would later find him in Deathly Hallows Part 2. 

**Other possible projects**

* Goblin wars show
* **Young Voldemort movie/show**
* Squib project (about finding purpose despite not being able to use magic)
* **Ministry of Magic/MACUSA show (very political and basically the HP equivalent of Andor)**",How I'd fix the Wizarding World movie franchise,1673385465

harrypotter,"I, personally, feel that Snape and Lily knowing each other was random and just pulled out randomly. I think Rowling could have added a few small hints throughout the books for rereads as she did for the other books' plot twists. It just kind of surprised me when she did not build up to such a huge reveal.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, so now for where I think she could have added a hint. In OotP, Draco Malfoy insults Harry's mother causing Harry to be banned from quidditch by Umbridge. 

\&gt;“Or perhaps,” said Malfoy, leering as he backed away, “you can remember what your mother’s house stank like, Potter, and Weasley’s pigsty reminds you of it —”

I think it would have been cool if Snape was either on the field and reacted after Harry attacked Malfoy of course so the story could continue. Maybe Snape did not stop Malfoy from getting hurt like Harry expected and just stared with a sneer.  Or maybe instead of Snape being on the field,  McGonagall told Snape when Snape asked and Snape gave Malfoy detention.

They found an unpleasant-looking silver instrument, something like a many-legged pair of tweezers, which scuttled up Harry’s arm like a spider when he picked it up, and attempted to puncture his skin. Sirius seized it and smashed it with a heavy book entitled Nature’s Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy. There was a musical box that emitted a faintly sinister, tinkling tune when wound, and they all found themselves becoming curiously weak and sleepy, until Ginny had the sense to slam the lid shut; a heavy locket that none of them could open; a number of ancient seals; and, in a dusty box, an Order of Merlin, First Class, that had been awarded to Sirius’s grandfather for services to the Ministry.

harrypotter,"I've seen the play in San Francisco and read the script. The story is fantastic. It had been 19 years since the Second War. In 19 years, muggles had invented computers that work as phones that fit in our pockets, self-driving cars, etc etc. In 19 years, it's entirely feasible that Time-Turners were reinvented and improved in the wizarding world. Draco is the inventor and despite his character arc in the harry potter stories, we never knew his academic achievements. I can see him being passionate about time travel because he has so many regrets from the past. Hermione is Minister for Magic, of course. Ron works with George at WWW fitting his character. Harry is an Auror, of course. Each of them has grown to become adults in those 19 years, becoming parents, and achieving/giving up on their dreams. They have matured and changed. Most of the opinions hating on the cursed child involve it being ""fan fiction"", the world not following the ""rules"" of the harry potter stories (19 years prior...), and that the characters have changed from their core beliefs (19 years prior...)

It is not ""fan fiction"", it's canon. The author of the story decided that this story was the one that she wanted to include in the canon of the story. It is written by a playwright rather than a young adult fantasy writer. So many of the qualms about the writing or story should simply be because you wanted something different to happen. If Rowling had been the original writer, you would say it was fantastic. The harry potter series is not flawless, there are numerous continuity issues within it regarding the ""rules"" of the wizarding world and the personality of the characters, and she completely caters to the audience she is writing for in the last book, but you do not call that ""fan-fiction"" because she was the writer. 

From 18 years old to 37 years old, most, if not all, people change, drastically. Wisdom is a real thing that occurs over time and each of these characters shows that the way they think is different from being a child. Harry's relationship with Albus is severely strained as many teenager/parent relationships are because the teenager is becoming their own person. 

Delphi being the daughter of Voldemort and Bellatrix is another point of contention. For some reason, people on this subreddit think that Voldemort is incapable or uninterested in sex because it was never mentioned in the harry potter series. Voldemort is a power-crazed dictator who would do anything to survive. He was a psychopath incapable of love or affection. But it is naive to think that sex is attached to love or affection. Sex is a biological function along with any cultural meaning that has been attached to it. Voldemort having sex with Bellatrix is entirely possible, and I would argue is accurate of his character. Bellatrix wanting to have the child of the person she was obsessed with is also a part of her character. It would increase her infamy playing into her ego as the only person to be close enough to the dark lord to have his child. Delphi grew up the same as Harry did. Both parents' true identities were hidden from her, growing up in a house with someone that did not like her, knowing parseltongue, and discovering who she truly was and the prophecy about her in her early teens.

- Grindelwald relied on his skills alone, while Voldemort simply relied on his immortality. Voldemort was very skilled, but he mostly picked enemies much weaker than himself, and tried to avoid his one equally matched wizard (Dumbledore) at all cost. Also Grindelwald managed to subdue the Elder wand, even though he only stole it, while Voldemort didn't.

-Grindelwalds followers were actually loyal to him. They respected him. Only a few Death eaters followed Voldemort out of Loyalty. Most of them followed him, out of fear. That makes Grindelwalds followers much more willing to risk their lives for him, than Voldemorts followers.

harrypotter,"I can't imagine this has never been posted before, but I haven't seen it if it has. But I just love the idea of a Harry and Dudley reunion down the road. 

After the final interaction with the Dursleys, I think we can all agree that Dudley partially redeemed himself. No, it doesn't alleviate all of the mistreatment of Harry over the years alongside Vernon and Petunia. But... He was still a kid when he was extra terrible to Harry and did seem to grow quite a bit after the dementor attack. I'm sure we all were terrible to some degree when we were young, but realizing this and changing for the better (hopefully) is part of growing up, and Dudley seemed to gain some perspective the following couple of years. 

So that brings me to the point of this post: after the amicable farewell between Harry and Dudley in DH, I like to think that the two reunited at some point in the future and even maybe became fond of each other, almost as if they were family... 

I saw a while back a fan fic post about the older crew showing up for Christmas at the Burrow from Mrs. Weasley's loving perspective. In that post, Kreacher was present, indicting a reunion with Harry after the Battle and a positive relationship forming out of an originally negative one. I'd love to see something similar with Harry and Dudley. I know he would probably never want to see Vernon and Petunia again, and vice versa, but I think that Harry and Dudley meeting up at some point and even having children that grew up knowing their cousins on that side of the family would be cool. Even if it was just something short like the above-mentioned fan fic. 

And if we really wanted to break that thang open, what if Dudley had a kid who wound up being a witch or wizard?? I mean... Dudley is related to the Potter side by blood via Lily, so it could definitely happen. I think a storyline where not only do we see the Harry/Dudley relationship develop, but we also see Dudley learning how to deal with being the parent of a wizard after the traumas and upbringing he experienced as a young boy. 

I'm not thinking a drawn out series or anything, just a fun little something something like the Christmas Burrow story. I don't know, maybe there isn't as much to it as I'm thinking, but I think there is some cool/fun potential there.",Dudley reunion?,1673375774

harrypotter,"It comes as no surprise that there is a prejudice between the Wizarding World, and also Muggles. But can you believe that such prejudice could be created by Hogwarts itself? 

Today we're going to look at this topic with another tongue and cheek humor. Lets do this! 

First off we should know that the Wizarding World exist in secret due to the persecutions faced by them during the Middle Ages, and this was when Muggles were feeling that religious fever so to speak. But the interesting thing is as much as Hogwarts was founded to teach the wizarding arts. Salazar Slytherin the founder of House Slytherin wanted Hogwarts to be a school of pure born practitioners to be allowed to practice magic. He even took Godric Gryffindor's tathered hat to create, you guessed it.....The Sorting Hat to of course place prospective students into such houses.

So early on Sly Salazar schemed a tradition that is still used today, even it those intentions are to put it in a better term, ""good"". While later of course Daddy Salazar would leave Hogwarts with intentions of his own and disappear. He would leave behind The Chamber of Secrets for which had a Basalisk to be unleashed to kill off Muggle raised and Half Bloods to make way for those dastardly pure bloods like them annoying Malfoys. 

""But Ferrum you say, Hogwarts was a sanctuary for the Wizards and Witches, it's not that bad.""

While this might be true, even evil is a road paved with good intentions. Keep in mind that while Dumbledore did in fact eventually go on to become headmaster at Hogwarts. Before his time there, as revealed in the Fantastic Beast stories, and Deathly Hallows, him and Grindelwald shared a deep connection to look for those dark relics so they too could become masters of death. While Dumbledore might have wanted nothing but good intentions, his blind devotion to Grindelwald would have him follow such a dark path, making an unbreakable oath, and eventually cause him to duel Grindelwald for the fated Elder Wand. So while he sought to redeem himself, the hunger for power was always there.

Finally lets talk about the deeper secret, The Founding Houses, while competition is all in good fun and humor? Much animosity has always flourished between the Houses. Especially Gryffindor and Slytherin. Examples can be found between James Potter and Snape over Lily. Then you also have Harry and Draco, though in time they do put their differences aside to face Voldemort and the Death Eaters too. The point is rivalry runs deep, and while competition is big for the House Cup. Much of that rivalry still can carry over after the years at Hogwarts. 

So it begs for one to wonder, does Hogwarts and the Houses help influence the Wizarding World? Or consume it from within?

harrypotter,"In every book some form illegal magic happens around Harry which kind of predicts the main plot of the story.

First one - maybe a bit of a stretch but Hagrid illegally uses his wand to curse Dudley (he even tells Harry not to mention the incident to anyone) after which they go together to Gringotts where the Philosopher's Stone

Second one - Dobby comes to warn Harry about the Chamber of Secrets plot and tell him not to go to Hogwarts. Because Harry refuses, Dobby levitates the cake which prompts the Ministry to send him a warning letter

Third one - Harry runs away from the Dursleys after blowing his aunt and runs into Sirius/Padfoot

Fourth one - Harry almost gets attacked by Ministry employees because someone used his wand to cast the Dark Mark. We later learn that this was Crouch Jr who is working to resurrect Voldemort

Fifth one - Dementors in Little Whinging prompt Harry to cast a Patronus which sets up the conflict between Harry and the Ministry throughout the book

Sixth one - This one is a little bit reversed. Dumbledore comes to pick up Harry to find Slughorn and tells him to have his wand out ready in case but tells him not to worry because he (Harry) is with him (Dumbledore) and then takes Harry on side-along apparition. At the end Dumbledore tells Harry that he is not worried because he is with him and Harry illegally (as he does not yet have an apparition license) takes Dumbledore back to Hogsmeade via side-along apparition

Seventh one - Harry performs a bunch of spells during the battle of the seven Potters despite being underage, but the biggest one is Harry's wand attacking Voldemort, which prompts Voldemort to go on his quest for the Elder Wand

harrypotter,"Also known as Darth Wannabe.

More to the point, I'm referring to a certain minor character from Jim Butcher's famous book series, The Dresden Files, introduced in the short story ""Day Off"" in the compilation book ""Side Jobs"" as the 'antagonist' of what's one of the funniest moment in the entire franchise. And I wanted to know what you think of both this particular story and the series as a whole, since the subject matter is more or less the same and there are many references to Harry Potter in it.

Why, exactly, am I posting this? To elaborate: That series deals with wizards, monsters and magic on a large scale, taking inspiration from all sorts of mythologies and folk stories and even urban legends in very creative ways while still finding a way to be accurate to the source material. And among the hordes of characters inspired by creatures of legend and mythical characters, we have a **very** minor magic talent who Harry Dresden, the main character, derides as a poser and threatens with a revolver.

Especifically, 'Darth Wannabe' is a young ""magic practitioner"" leading his own troupe of Ringwraith reject to get back at Dresden, the eponymous protagonist (Who actually got his name from Houdini, not Potter), 'cause he undid a ""curse"" he cast (Something so minor it was unmade with just some reiki). He tries to be impressive and dramatic, but Dresden calls him and his friends a bunch of tryhards who wears a lot of black, drive a van with goat skulls and inverted crosses painted on the sides and, of course, wear Slytherin scarves and have Dark Marks tattooed on their arms; he even tells them that while he liked the movies, you don't see them going *that* far.

Then, when they challenge to a duel, he tells the Dim Lord and his flying monkeys that if they want to see magic then he can show them some magic. Not by actually casting a spell ('Cause that'd be overkill against those kids), but making the windows on their van disappear with some good ol' gunshots.

Now that you got some context, tell me: If you know of this series, what do you think of it in general and/or compared to this series? I'm sure that you ought to at least have an opinion on stuff like wizardry being nigh completely self-taught, magic having no language for its spellcasting and the presence of characters like The Fair Folk, vampires that are more like their myths portrayed than what modern media says they are, full-blown gods and demons and even belief systems integrated into magic as a whole.

And if you don't, what do you think of this story? And no, the author wasn't actually taking cheap shots at Harry Potter or anything of the sort (And neither am I, for that matter). It's just that, since wizards are more integrated to modern-day civilization compared to wizarding society (Which says a lot, since Dresden wizards can and do live for hundreds of years if given the chance), there HAD to be practitioners of some sort who thought that being a Death Eater would be a good idea. lol",The Dim Lord,1673330685
harrypotter,"I’m sure there’s a book reason for this, but why didn’t Dumbledore just leave Harry his wand (the elder wand) in his will? In Half Blood prince (the movie), after DD dies Harry is seen holding it and every time I see this scene I think “man, he would’ve saved himself so much trouble if he just took it then or snapped it right there.” 

I know that Harry didn’t snap it in the books and I know he didn’t know about the deathly hallows at this point but what I don’t understand is why Dumbledore just didn’t leave him the elder wand since he had already left him the other one ???",Dumbledore’s reasoning for not bequeathing the Elder wand to Harry ?,1673329814
harrypotter,"So I’ve just finished my once a year Harry Potter runthrough and I’ve just been wondering, is it necessary for me to watch the Fantastic Beasts movies as well? Do they expand on the story line, or are they their own seperate arc? I’ve never watched them when they came out in theatres because I didn’t know what they were and I’m very picky lmao. I have HBO and notice that they are on the service as well and want to know if they contribute or if they’re kinda just like their own “meh” arc of the Harry Potter series. TIA",Is watching Fantastic Beasts necessary?,1673327682
harrypotter,"(When I say unrealistic, of course, I mean within the logic of this fantasy world)

I was 18 I think when I read The Order of The Phoenix for the first time and one thing I always found 'odd' was how easily they enter the Ministry of Magic without no one seeing them!

I mean, in the muggle world we have from more basic security systems to more complex and hard to crack ones. 
Cameras, security guards, locks, alarms, etc. And for a public building like that, I expected good security.

Of course, they wouldn't be ""cameras"" there,  but not guard? no magic detectors or alarms? maybe I was expecting some equivalent to our security system somehow. 

Am I the only one who thought this was kinda odd? 

(Apologies for my mistakes, English is not my first language)","What was the ""one thing"" that was unrealistic to you while you were reading the books? For me was the gang infiltrating the Ministry of Magic without being caught",1673327564
harrypotter,"Quick note: this O.C. would be around at least 50-100 years after the events of Harry Potter. 

So I know most of the time, (it feels like) when people make an original character it's a student. but I had an idea for a teacher. This Teacher would teach Care of Magical Creatures and is a Half-Giant and Werewolf. But unlike every other Werewolf he is the first one who can fully control himself. Meaning if for some reason they needed to do a class at night during a full moon. He would be able to 100% no issue. (Just might get a tail wag when you answer correctly)

**Looks:** But Let's see if I can describe him well enough for you to picture them. I want to say he is about 9 feet in height, and very very muscular. I guess think of something between Hulk and Professor Hulk. Black hair in the style of a mohawk, reminiscent to a viking style. And of course he's just hairy all over thanks to the werewolf in him. Has lots of faded tattoos that look like they could be 1, very very detailed and it's just hard to tell now. OR they were just always a mess. A beard in between Hagrids and Dumbledore but tied into one braid. He has one Blue eye and one fully white eye with a nice scar going from the top of that eyebrow to his upper lip, (with a few other scars over his body) and his K9 teeth are always a bit bigger, even when not a werewolf. 

**Clothing**: For clothing he would wear just a harness on around his torso during the hot months were he would have bags attached to keep everything he needs. During the winter months he wears a normal shirt with the sleeves (most of the time) ripped off. 1-3 belts at all time depending on what he needs with him. For bottoms you can see him in some just normal pants, sometimes a fur-like kilt or one year a student got him a pair of super nice Jeans which he only wears if he is going to Hogsmead or on the weekends.

**Personality**: For being so ""rugged"" He takes great care of himself. making sure he never smells (students and teachers say he smells like firewood, a tiny bit of musk with a hint of vanilla. His Voice is deep and with a guttural growl to it. to the point he can scare people if he is not careful. He also knows signed language and teaches it to students who want to learn. to put his personality in a very blunt text. ""Looks like they can kill you, is a cinnamon roll. It's hard to get him upset but you can tell when that happens because he starts to stutter.

**Magical / Abilities:** Despite being a werewolf/half-gaint he is well versed in magic. Seemingly because of all the negative stereotypes put on him, He worked that much harder to overcome them and show people what he is capable of. He is even able to do wandless and wordless magic (though of course not nearly as strong) and can even block a few spells with himself alone. (Remember they needed to hit Hagrid with 4 stun spells before it did anything to him.) While in his werewolf form he is of course much stronger and faster but can't use magic. 

**Weaknesses:** While he works very hard to make sure he comes off nice and approachable some days it can be harder then others. Due to his size and voice he can be scary. to the point normally 1st years avoid him at all costs until a older student or teacher comes in and changes that. As stated before when he gets upset he starts to stutter, and goes until he looses his temper (which is extremely rare) and when that happens he turns into a crying mess. Also While is able to control himself, he knows at one point his werewolf instincts might be to much and that scares him. He is also known to be a bit to confident. Once having to be talked out of being hit with a killing curse because as he put it ""My pecs are so big it would bounce right off"" But that only happens after a few hours of drinking.

**Fun Facts**  
1. He ""owns"" 3 wands. His own and his Mothers, and his grandfathers.  
2. All Wands are inside one wand that is more like a staff to normal people. He rarely uses it however. More or less using ""wandless magic""  
3. His own ""personal"" wand was a 20 inch blackthorn with a dragon heartstring core.  
4. He was in  Gryffindor, but almost was put in Hufflepuff. The shorting hat took a bit trying to choose  
5. He was in the top 10 of his class  
6. Tried to play quidditch but brooms really cant hold that much weight  
7.  Hagrid is a hero to him  
8. He loves to apperate  
9. He wants to try and master fiendfyre but is to nervous to do so.  
10. Before coming teacher he was an Auror.  
11. One time while eating breakfast a bad wizard hit him with a curico curse. He finished his breakfast then calmly walked over to the gun before punching him out cold. Thats one of his more favorite rumors.  
12. During the summer months he takes a bath in the lake. Just be careful going out around midnight.  
13. He lives pretty much in the same spot where Hagrid lived. However his hut is bigger and has more of a ""castle light house"" feel to it.  
14. He is pansexual and has been known to be the ""handsome teacher"" by students and teachers. However if you say anything he turns beat red.  
15. He tries to help in the kitchen, but due to his size really can't and mostly annoys the house elves.  
17.  He swears... a lot  
18. He has a sister (fully human wizard) who works in the M.O.M. Her son goes to Hogwarts.  
19. In between Hogwarts and being an Auror he worked in a more ""adult"" field  
20. He is a candidates to one day become headmaster   
21. He LOVES LOVES LOVES to sing. However he sounds worse then mermaids out of the water.

harrypotter,"Hermione most likely felt insecure about herself in her own way, although not showing it. She most likely felt she was not attractive enough, not funny enough and simply not Ron's tempo. This might be one reason why she was so mad at Fleur all the time. She scowled when she kissed Ron, and was thoroughly foul to Fleur when she stayed at the Burrow. Because Fleur was a born beauty to male eyes from her genes alone. Having been mocked look-wise before, she probably felt that Ron would never choose her. And the fact that she was inherently nerdy while Ron obviously seemed to prefer hanging with more laid-back, outwardly funny and joking styled kids more (not that he didn't like Hermione being around him) probably didn't help.

As for Ron, it's obvious why he was insecure. Krum and Potter. Both of them famous throughout countries. One for being an amazing Quidditch player. One for hoodwinking the dark lord almost every year since he attended Hogwarts, and beating him as a boy. Both were extremely popular and liked by girls (Harry was only really liked after he did something cool, like prove he was right which in the eyes of girls, made him some masculine tough god who was strong and resilient). And, as Hermione's other best friend, both were on equal terms with Hermione, so he wouldn't really have a head start on her if it became a race to see who could charm her.

So in the end, both were just so blinded by the negative mindset of ""oh, they're gonna want someone else"" that they couldn't realize that the ""competition"" they had wasn't even real. Krum was more of a friend/experimental relationship than a long-term partner. Harry showed no signs of romantic affection for Hermione and likewise. And Fleur was more of eye-candy to Ron than someone he'd actually date in the future. Both actually liked each other, but couldn't even see it.",I thoroughly enjoyed how Ron and Hermione always liked each other but were too insecure and jealous to see it,1673324332

harrypotter,"Currently rereading the books after having only read them when I was very young, and something has become glaringly obvious; Harry Potter is a stupid child who is too proud for his own good. 

It’s obvious that it’s because he is young and stupid, thinking he always knows right because that’s what teenagers do. But because the movies follow an actor who ages 2-3 years between each movie that only has a 1 year gap, it feels like Harry is more mature in the 4th movie onwards. Radcliffe also acts older in his delivery and I can’t help but feel like they probably wrote the movies that way to make him sound more his own age. 

It’s not until you read the book when you realize that Harry Potter is painfully young. So young that I’ve been yelling in my head about things that happen in the 4th and 5th books simply because if he just wasn’t such a proud little brat, things would be so much easier for everyone. He could tell the truth, speak, and ask questions, but having watched the movies for so long, I’ve forgotten how young he is and how undeveloped that makes his brain. Hermione acts like the only sane person in a group of idiots, being the only voice of reason for a grown up reader which is a nice way to grasp some sense of sanity when I’m reading a young teen make bafflingly accurate decisions for someone his age.","It’s very easy to forget how young Harry is supposed to be in the movies, but NOT in the books",1673318875

harrypotter,"As many of you know, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child recently made its return to major theatre areas around the world. This new version of the play was only one part as opposed to two, cut around 1.5 hours worth of story, and features a new love story. I never saw the original version of the play, but I did read the script... and like a lot of people, I truly hated most of what I read. The characterizations of everyone were terrible, the constant usage of nostalgia felt off-putting, and the idea that Cedric Diggory was an important-enough character to warrant the entire ""eighth story"" in the HP being about him was just so weird. I didn't have any plans to see this on the stage and thought that was the end.

But this month, a family member of mine, who's a big fan of Harry Potter, got tickets to see this new version of the story. I was invited to watch it as well, so I attended the show in Toronto. I said to myself, even though I didn't like the script, I wanted to keep an open mind about what I was about to watch. Even with my problems with the story, I was intrigued by how the crew would pull off the production/magic stuff. 

I sat in my seat, the lights went down, and for 3 hours and 20 minutes, I was... incredibly disappointed. This story just does not work. In every sense of it, this story falters completely. The pacing is terrible, the dialogue is atrocious, Harry Potter is an absolutely terrible father despite nothing in the previous stories pointing to this becoming a possibility, most female characters are shafted completely then reappear randomly (Ginny, Rose, and even Hermoine), Ron gets nothing to do, Delphi is without-a-doubt the worst villain in the franchise, and the usage of Voldemort, Snape, and Cedric had my rolling my eyes. Somehow, the show felt jarringly fast and incredibly slow at the same time. In order to save time from the previous version, the first 20 minutes feel like an F1 race on steroids before coming to a screeching halt to actually set up the story, which again, is so boring and pretty confusing to keep up with. 

The saving grace of this new version is Albus and Scorpius' love story, which is a new addition. Despite not getting nearly enough time to actually explore their relationship, they were just adorable together, but nothing more. Honestly, if you do without all the bigger Harry Potter stuff, this story between the two young men would be a fairly standard, and enjoyable rom-com. But no, we have to get a story about Harry constantly going after Albus and Albus acting like the worst teenager to ever exist. 

I don't know if it's Jack Thorne, Rowling, or whoever else was involved in the writing of both versions of this story, but it's just awful. This should've probably been a movie to begin with, as then they could at least pull this thing off visually, but even then, after reading the script, I'd say kill it with fire. 

The actual production of the play was solid, with the crew using pretty cool optical illusions and practical effects to pull off the magic of the universe. But after a while, you'll find yourself wondering about how something would've and could've looked better if this was just a movie or TV show. There are just certain things in the HP universe that don't work on stage... mainly, WIZARD SPELLS. 

I'm all for supporting stage productions, but this one is just bad. I guess it's a saving grace that I saw the 3-hour version instead of the 5... because if I almost fell asleep during the Toronto production, who knows what would've happened in the London production. 

And just one more thing... none of this has anything to do with the cast. If any of you come across this post, know that none of you are the problem with this show and you all did a fine job. The writing is not nearly up to par with your acting skills.",I recently watched the revised version of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child and I have a lot of thoughts...,1673309785
harrypotter,"Just curious really. If anything I would of liked to seen a bit more of the other characters time to shine. Like maybe a chapter where we go from Neville to Ginny to someone else just to see them fight and stuff.

harrypotter,"Rumours about a reboot don't really surprise me every major franchise gets remade or rebooted sooner or later and I'm actually surprised it took this long. My main worries about them rebooting the series is firstly if they decide to make new movies I feel not enough time has passed and the 8 movies we got were good solid adaptations and I think new movies won't be as good and will receive the same complaints people have for the other movies about stuff that gets left out.

Now as many people have said a tv series would be the perfect way to go about it and be able to be more faithful to the books. My biggest worry however is will the people who work on a potential series be passionate about making a faithful adaptation of these stories because I could totally see them wanting to put their own stamp on the series and make a lot of unnecessary changes to make it completely different from the books and movies. Also given Warner Bros handling of major franchises in recent years it leaves me less than confident about how they would go about any sort of reboot.

You can name a hundred bad adaptation, but the one as unanimously loved by their fandom as hp are few and far between.

To start with we know that the population of witches and wizards is low during the events of the books. After dealing with the magical wars, two by voldemort and one grindlewald, there is likely to be a baby boom just like with our world after world war 2. Because of the acceptance of muggle born witch and wizards into wizarding society the population will soon ovwrtake muggles. We don't know the rates at which these people are born but given how many appear in the books I think it is fair to say the numbers are significant and only going to rise. 

An argument against this is the birth of squibs or non magical people born to magical family's. However I would argue that there is clear evidence that these people are likely to stay in the wizarding world. Filch is evidence that squibs are not kicked out of society, given how prejudiced the wizarding community is shown to be I'm sure that most squibs are treated as second class citizens, but I would say they are still more likely to stay in the wizarding world this I'd because they are not likely to leave to the almost alien muggle world. Arthur Weasley who is meant to work in the field of muggles is fascinated by simply things like the underground escalator and a rubber duck. The average wizard is going to be terrified at the idea of joining the muggle world. I would also say that life for squibs in the wizarding world is likely to get better again proved by Flitch working at one of the most prestigious wizarding school in the world. We are also shown that the younger generations are much more progressive when it comes to non magical people showing again that life will improve as the years pass. Plus there is the improvement to life that comes with living inside a magical world even without magic, bewitched items to make life easier would surely make even people without magic want to stay. 

Another point against my theory is that the magical world is just more dangerous, so the numbers of population will not grow. Jobs like inventing magic potions and caring for dangerous magical creatures and plants. But to this I would say these jobs are more likely to be few and far between rather than the norm. The magical world must have stores, restaurants and business of all kinds. Just like in the muggle world most jobs are likely to be safe. Even with the dangous jobs it is clear that health care in the wizarding world is much better than the muggle with people living much longer and being healed from most injuries and illnesses. 

Now if you accept my point that the population will rise through the decades then I believe this would bring in many changes for the wizarding world namely lack of jobs. With magic the jobsof ten people can be done with one spell and with better health care and easy work, just casing spells the age and amount of people retiring is like to go down substantially. This will make more witches and wizards poorer and dangling on the poverty line. Also as the population grows space will come at a premium. We have seen that magic can do strange things with space (tent at quidditch world cup) but even with this there is only so much space and so much money to buy the available space to go around. This will push poor and poorer witches and wizards closer and closer to the muggle world with poor people almost rubbing shoulders with muggles. 

I  belive this will all come to a head with poor witch's and wizards being becoming poorer and angrier and angrier. I belive it wouldn't take much, a charismatic smooth talking dark witch or wizard, to use this unrest. They could to work their way up the political system to be voted minister of magic. They could then use this position with the backing of the people to start a war with the muggle world for space and control of the planet. This dark Lord would be different than any that came before as unlike Voldemort this person would have the backing of a country and more legitimacy. 

I know what your thinking, earlier I argued that the wizarding world is getting more progressive now I'm say there is going to be a war with them. The difference is I didn't say which ministry was going to war. It is clear that there are a great many. There is the British one in the main books then there is an American ministry, who is to say there is not a great many ministries just like in the muggle world, all with different ideas and ideals of how the world should work just like in this world. But it just takes one of them to be corrupted by a dark wizard or by bad politics for a war to start. 

In closing I belive this is inevitable as the population grows and poor people are squeezed more and more, hiding will seem almost pointless, the liklihood goes up and up as population rises. We know there are many dark wizards who could easily use this tension to rise up and exercise power, the angrier the people are the easier it will be to turn the anger on to an ""other"" in this case muggles. But there will still be progressive wizards and a progressive ministry who will fight to save muggles but this will most likely, with the massive number of wizards, lead to the unveiling of the wizarding world. The outcome of the war in my mind is irrelevant, as soon as it starts the wizarding world is over and it is just the world with whole new challenges of co habition.

I belive the only thing that could stop this outcome are more magical wars, if the wizarding world can't come together and get along long enough for their numbers to grow they can't outnumber muggles. If the magical community doesn't progress as is expected and doesn't become more welcoming to non magical people like squibs and muggleborns and pushes them out of the magical world and into the muggle one then the overpopulation won't happen as quickly or at all.

harrypotter,"Hot off the latest Xmas rewatch, I've been on a Potter bender.

One thing that stood out to me in this rewatch was Harry's emotional evolution and how expertly it's handled. I particularly love Harry's choices in Prisoner of Azkaban. See, a complaint about Harry Potter is that if he would just tell the adults AKA Dumbledore what's going on, a lot of problems would be solved. However, Book 3 really presents a plausible reason for Harry to not be able to share what he knows with Dumbledore, as Sirius is at first a personal vendetta Harry feels some shame for, and later as a fugitive, Harry can't fully expose Sirius.

Then, by the time Harry realizes he really just needs to tell Dumbledore what's up, the headmaster becomes a fugitive. Then, he dies.

So this question of ""Just tell the adults what you know"" becomes complicated very very quickly.

Now let's consider why Harry is the ""Boy who lived"". As he says, even up until Order of the Phoenix, his phenomenal 3/3 record against Voldemort is due to luck, help and unknown factors. He of all people, worthy because of confronting fear and danger courageously, nevertheless admits that his success is not in any way a product of his own skill or power.

Harry lived because of Lily's old magic spell. That was broken by Voldemort's deep spell. Azkaban, the only book where Harry did not confront Voldemort, features a telling prophecy, and the events surrounding Pettigrew. I suspect there is a link between the prophecy and the intention of Voldemort. In the magical world, powerful wizards shape events which become spells. These are mirrored by prophecies which become more true as the spells grow in power. Understand?

In the book ""Johnathan Strange and Mr. Norrell"" there are two gentlemen of England, who many years after the disappearance of magic, are somehow able to do it again. In the end, a strange and seemingly minor encounter with a malicious fey folk becomes a massive set of spells that changes England. It turns out this seemingly random, malicious fey might have been connected to the great master of English magic since Merlin, the Raven King. The random events circumscribing the lives of Johnathan Strange and Mr. Norrell turn out to be products of a weird and wonderfully planned spell by the Raven King to trick and defeat this powerful and evil fairy. The fairy is totally tricked, almost up to the level in which Eru Iluvatar tricks and defeats Sauron by using the curse of his own magic to - through Gollum by way of the kindness of Frodo - curse the Ring to meet its own demise.

I am completely certain, through Deathly Hallows, that Dumbledore used the Deathly Hallows - a very vague, mysterious, and tangentially but mysteriously powerful magic - to complete a spell he had been casting for many years. Harry Potter was merely a lucky ingredient of the spell to defeat Voldemort. Yes, Voldemort was defeated because of a masterful, god-tier advanced spell of Dumbledore in which Harry was a mere ingredient.

Thus, in this interpretation of advanced magic where manipulating people and events and incorporating varieties of magic produces strong and unimpeachable results, Slytherin House was made part of Hogwarts.

We easily forget the emblem of Ravenclaw isn't - lol - a raven. It's an Eagle. This is an imperial emblem. The lion is regal. The badger is defiant. The snake is something else.

Hogwarts is not merely a school. It is a spell cast upon English magic. It is as profound as the spell of the Raven King. It affects all English magic, and resonates through the wider world due to England's connection to old magic.

It's not that Slytherin is tolerated. Slytherin is part of the spell. The Basilisk was the spell's concession to Salazar. Yes, of course Slytherin is evil. But Hogwarts is a spell meant to drive a line between the muggle and magical worlds. To protect BOTH of them, and allow wizards to deal with the arcane and dangerous elements of the magical universe (goblins, beasts, elves, etc.)

Thus we must not think of Slytherin as evil. Instead. We must become part of the spell, the legacy of Merlin. We must be grateful that magic and muggle are regulated and put in order, for the benefit of both.

The topic of what muggles might do to the magical world is fascinating. It invokes the concept of ""before"" old magic. Of a magic that muggles can invoke, the grand and greater spells. Magic can't make food or gold. The mundane and profane can. Science is like a sweeping uber-magic. It's universal common sense. Plato's forms, shared by all to no one's benefit unless they are universally obeyed. Where the wizard can refuse to obey, the muggle must. But, the muggle, in obeying, might gain a greater power.

I have never been a fan of David Yates. He ruined OotP for me by cutting out a lot of the scenes that really showcased Harry's growth as a character. I've always thought that the odd-numbered installments in HP (with the exception of Deathly Hallows) were more about character development and how everything was affecting him, while the even-numbered installments were more story-driven. Yet Yates cut most of those scenes out, and pulled a lot of punches (i.e. muting Harry's scream when Sirius falls through the veil and not having him lash out at Dumbledore the way he did in the book). And where the hell was the scene where it was revealed that Umbridge (who was nowhere near as sadistic as she was in the book) ordered the dementor attack on Harry? The only thing I was impressed by was his adapting the longest book in the series into the shortest film, but I think they could have made an alternate cut of the film with some of the scenes that were left on the cutting room floor being added and some of the existing scenes being cut which would be roughly the same length.

He got better with the subsequent films (possibly due to Steve Kloves returning as screenwriter) but they still weren't as good IMO as the first four films. I know that politics play a significant part in the story, but the tone of Yates's later films is a little too political IMO. Combining the politics with the way in which most of the characters are dressed in the later films hardly makes it seem like a fantasy film about wizards at all.

I don't agree with the stuff that JKR has said in recent years, but I think she's a good writer, and I think Steve Kloves is a good screenwriter. But David Yates is not a good director for the Wizarding World franchise because he doesn't know which scenes are essential to the story and which ones can be cut or re-worked. Also, Yates went from directing low-budget, made-for-TV movies to one of the largest franchises of all time without any stepping stones in between. Chris Columbus had ""Home Alone"", Alfonso had ""A Little Princess"", Mike Newell had ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" as well as an extensive resume dating back to the 1960s (I don't think his ""Bollywood"" direction style would have worked for most of the films but it worked for GoF), and Yates? The previous film he directed before OotP was ""The Girl in the Cafe"", and all of his films were either TV movies or shorts. Outside of the UK he was practically unknown. So he was an odd choice of director IMO.

I still think they have a shot at steering the FB franchise in the right direction but they need to get the right person for the job.","What if the reason why the FB series failed isn't because of JKR and the writers, but because of David Yates?",1673215994

harrypotter,"I decided to read through the HP books for the first time in many years, taking notes about various things as I did so to keep track of everything.

One of those things is the locations of various places within Hogwarts and, more specifically to this post, the entrance to the Gryffindor common room. I'd gotten the majority of the way through the first book believing that the entrance to the Gryffindor Tower was through a hole behind the portrait of the Fat Lady at the end of a corridor on the second floor.

My reason for thinking it's on the second floor is from a few pieces of evidence:

* When Percy first leads them to the common room from the Sorting Ceremony's feast, they climb multiple staircases - that puts it on a floor higher than floor 1 (i.e. at least floor 2).
* When going back to the common room after defeating the troll in the girls' toilet (which I believe is on the ground floor), Ron and Harry don't talk until they've climbed two floors up. Then a brief conversation is described and they reach the common room. From this quote, it's possible for the entrance to be more than two floors up, but I think it's implied to be on the second floor, and it's definitely not lower than the second floor.
* When going to the trophy room to duel Malfoy, they went up a staircase to the third floor. Now, even if there were more than just this one staircase (which isn't implied), this means that it's definitely below floor 3.

If it's at least as high as the second floor and lower than the third floor, it must be on the second floor - there's no other option.

Nothing contradicted this throughout the book, so I held fast to my belief. Until they sneak out at night to the forbidden third-floor corridor to stop ""Snape"" from stealing the Philosopher's stone. In this instance, they go up two sets of stairs - the first of which Mrs Norris is skulking at the top of and they climb around her, the second of which, which is mentioned as ""the staircase up to the third floor"", Peeves is floating halfway up.

I was a bit confused by the contradiction to what I thought was the truth, so I googled for the location of the Gryffindor common room. Imagine my surprise when all the sites say it's on the seventh floor! 

I looked at what the source for that is, and the wiki says ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game)."" Are the video games really the accepted source of canon over the books? Or is this backed up elsewhere in later books?

I'm going to note down the contradiction I found as a potential plot hole or potential for a strange Hogwarts layout (e.g. the first corridor led to a balcony halfway up the second floor and the second corridor led the rest of the way up to the third floor) and keep making notes as I read to try and figure it out. But the thing with the seventh floor is just crazy imo, since there are at least two quotes showing them going upwards from the common room to the third floor.

harrypotter,"I’ve been rewatching the Harry Potter films recently and beside the fact I think there are a lot of issues with how jk wrote and told the story of character’s one who I always will think is unfairly hard done by and wasted is Draco.

Jk Rowling should of written a book showing the life of Draco and his mother, by how their relationship and the lestrange family seem I’d think that Narcissus marriage to Lucius was arranged and abusive and that part of Dracos horrible attitude came from his home life and how his father was horrible to him and his mother. 
Rowling should of written a book showing a pov of Dracos home life and maybe even including how his mother and father met. Rowling then should of showed different areas of Draco’s life leading up to half blood Prince which then goes into Dracos battle with wanting to be good but being in a situation where he’s forced to be bad.

A book like this could of been really interesting and given Dracos character the depth it really needed.
However all in all I hate Dracos ending anyway I think a much better ending would be if at the end of half blood Prince he chose not to kill Dumbledoor by his own choice not Snape stopping him and then joined the order leading him to help out in deathly hallows and maybe once again in his own book showing the effects of him being a Slytherin who turned good!",Jk Rowling should of made a separate Draco Malfoy book showing his pov.,1673215274

An example of this is how the trio end up at the shrieking shack. They didn't follow clues to catch Sirius Black like they would have in the previous writing style, In fact they only end up in the shrieking shack because Hermiones cat chased Scabbers/Peter to the womping willow. 

I find the fact that there was such a big shift in writing style after the second book and absolutely none of us cared quite amazing.

harrypotter,"... and boy did it raise a lot of questions. However, I'll just post 2 here:

1] Do wizards have no due process at all? Percival Graves just gets to make an instant, one-man decision on the death penalty, and everyone is down with it? Like, it must happen a lot since a) the American ministry has its own built-in execution chamber, and b) everyone - including Tina's coworkers - is just cool with putting her down immediately. 

Moreover, do these people not consider themselves Americans *even slightly?* They're surrounded by normal humans whose entire country is built around a notion of established and inalienable human rights. But their little sect has no rights at all? They're SO removed from muggles that their system is tantamount to a rule-by-fiat dictatorship?

2] Why haven't wizards taken over the world? In the books, magic seemed, if not quite trivial, then at least relatively on-par with the power of one-man technology. This is to say that a single wizard couldn't utter a few words and set off the equivalent of a nuclear bomb. Even when Voldemort and Co. blew up a bridge, that appeared to be a) an extremely impressive feat, and b) a group effort by the Death Eaters.

In Magical Beasts, not only are single wizards essentially wordlessly shattering buildings, but it's pretty clear that average American Aurors are just amble to effortlessly reassemble said destruction in seconds. 

Moreover, we know from the books that even a lot of wizards who AREN'T Death Eaters consider themselves to be superior to the rest of humanity. So you have this subset of elitist super-beings, many of whom think they've transcended humanity, and... Grindlewald and Voldemort are just wildly ""out there"" in aiming for some form of world conquest/subjugation? Wha??",Saw Fantastic Beasts for the first time last night...,1673198915

harrypotter,"Hottake: The way most people understand the house system is wrong. The way most people seem to think it works is like star signs, where you get a full batch of personality traits that you need to adhere to, most of them being subject to fairly substantial change in a normal human ages 11 to 17. 
 Due to this, a lot of people decry the house system as impractical, and bad, something that I am inclined to agree with 
HOWEVER, I don’t think that this is how it was intended, at least not by the founders of Hogwarts. 
 In the legend of the Secret Chamber, McGonnagal tells us about the founding of Hogwarts. She says that the founders couldn’t agree on which students to teach, so they all taught their own houses. Slytherin wanted to teach purebloods, so to get into Slytherin you needed to be a pureblood. To get into Ravenclaw you needed to hold knowledge as the highest virtue, to get into Gryffindor you needed to be exceptionally brave, and Hufflepuff took the rest. 
 This interpretation is way more practical from the viewpoint of the founders, as it solves their original problem.
The different personality traits that are assigned to the houses, I think are prejudices that evolved later: Samrt people are awkward eggheads, Brave people reckless jocks, etc. Being a stereotype for your house was never an intended requirement to get in. 
 Now I realise, that the legend is the only confirmation we have of this interpretation, but I at least think that this is the version that makes the most sense.","The house system has been completely misunderstood, and retconned!",1673188675

harrypotter,"Hi everyone!

Maybe it's the Ravenclaw in me, but I would absolutely love to do some data analysis to look for correlations and relationships between people's houses, wand types, patronuses, and other information.

If you'd like to participate, please comment your wizarding world information (house, wand, and patronus), as well as any other information you'd like to (but you dont have to) include, like your gender identity, Myers-Briggs type, where you're from (state or country), etc.

For example, here's mine:
- House: Ravenclaw
- Wand: Hawthorn, Phoenix Feather, 11 3/4 inches, unyielding
- Patronus: Siberian Cat
- Gender Identity: Female
- Myers-Briggs Type: ISFJ
- Where I'm From: Wisconsin, USA

The only thing I ask is that you only comment your official wizarding world results, not which house/wand/patronus you'd like to have. And please don't comment your results if you knowingly answered dishonestly to get the result you wanted, just because I want to keep the data as accurate as possible.

I'll need quite a few people to comment in order to get a large enough sample size, so even if you dont want to participate, if you could at least upvote this thread so more people will see it, I'd appreciate it.

Thank you!!

P.S. I'll definitely be posting an update with the results if i end up getting enough responses to have a big enough sample size to do an analysis.","Please comment your house, wand, and patronus so I can do a little data analysis",1673107536

I woke up mad and I’m still obviously thinking about it!

I know Molly is very sweet but I could kind of see this being a reality with her a “traditional” wife-and-mother type and Hermione being more of a modern woman. At the very least they might not always see eye to eye on issues like family and parenting. I’m sure canonically that Molly adores Hermione as a daughter-in-law… but I also wonder what her true thoughts might be about her as a lifelong partner for Ron.

harrypotter,"Specifically, about the prophecy. I would've written about it in my previous thread about it (see here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/sxz2pn/in\_harry\_potter\_do\_the\_prophecies\_all\_come\_true/](https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/sxz2pn/in_harry_potter_do_the_prophecies_all_come_true/)) but it was locked, so I'm making a new one. 

The prophecy was to be fulfilled, of that I'm almost certain for two reasons: 

1) Dumbledore lied to him about the fact that he must die in order to destroy the last horcrux inside of him, something it was certainly needed to fulfill the prophecy. Dumbledore in ""Half-Blood prince"" tries to convince Harry of the importance of acting of his own free will, but this must be surely because, being a very smart man, he knew Harry would've acted against it at the last moment, and reassuring him he must choose himself ensures him the prophecy, not the headmaster, will correct Harry's path. Don't forget that Dumbledore's plan was for Harry to fight Voldemort AFTER destroying all the horcruxes, while we all know the snake was still alive at the time. 

2) For me, at the last duel of Harry v Voldemort, the clue that the prophecy was in action was the fact the Elder Wand belonged to Harry. In the hands of Voldemort, it wouldn't have worked. Especially because Harry didn't intend to kill Voldemort. Instead, the Avada Kedavra made by Voldemort rebounded, but it all acted automatically, after the prophecy set things in motion. Chance wasn't there at that duel.

He fought Dumbledore and judging from the film, Dumbledore didn’t have problems facing someone holding the wand.  Dumbledore fought Voldemort using the wand at the ministry and impression’s are, what the difference with a wand that everyone’s using? The only thing I noticed about it was that when Voldemort used the wand to break the protection the wand went to pieces meaning that a regular wand couldn’t afford to do his bidding.

harrypotter,"Obviously Snape would no sooner tell Harry hints to help him to his face, than award Gryffindor 10 points for a job well done in class, but considering he and Dumbledore were in on the ""protect Harry at all costs"" plot, you'd think one of them would step up to the job. As for Dumbledore, this is even dumber. Yeah, I know there's a magical contract (and it makes NO sense how a magical object that's meant to choose 17+ year olds for a inter-school contest would create a magical contract that's above Dumbledore's magical powers to destroy/change it), but the contract never stopped Harry from cheating, or anyone else from cheating, at that. And obviously, playing fair in a competition that's reward is fame and 1000 galleons to the winner, is nothing compared to the grand plan of stopping the greatest Dark Wizard who seeks to put the world under his foot.

So why, may I ask, did Dumbledore not take every measure necessary to ensure Harry's safety. The kid could've died several times over (he almost got slammed by a Horntail's tail in the movie and got slashed in the arm in the books). If I was Dumbledore, I'd be taking no risks and be secretly giving him info from the sidelines. Heck, I'd even manipulate the competition while it unfolds to ensure his safety (come on, he's the greatest Wizard to live, there's no way that he'd be unable to hoodwink some Ministry officials and a bunch of teenagers to help Harry cheat). As for Snape, you'd think he'd convey some handy tips to someone else who'd convey it then, to Harry. He's been anonymously watching Harry from the sidelines and it's stupid how he'd be willing to take such a gamble on Lily's sake on something so dangerous.

harrypotter,"The series ends with the words “All was well”. But how can it be that all was well if nothing essentially changed after the defeat of Voldemort? 

The wizarding world is extremely racist towards every other sentient magical race (goblins, elves, merpeople, centaurs, giants, etc). Such a world allowed the Ministry of Magic to be formed, which constantly abuses its power and benefits from said racism (mainly via goblins and elves), while preventing all other races from using wands and thus maintaining their hegemony. It is out of that system that somebody like Voldemort rose to power and if you think about it nothing essentially changed after he was defeated. There were no systemic changes in their world that could prevent something like that happening again. And Voldemort really isn’t that much worse from the majority of other wizards, he is just more extreme and his racism extends to muggles and muggle-borns as well. 

After Rowling introduced elements to the world such as slavery or the goblin rebellions (in which the goblins had a violent uprising protesting against their mistreatment by wizards), defeating Voldemort simply isn’t a satisfying enough ending. 

Yet, none of the characters seem to care that the world is so broken. You would expect Harry to be a bit more empathetic considering he grew up in the muggle world and should thus not be desensitized but shocked at the inequality of this new world, yet he doesn’t care at all. When he finds out that Slughorn has been testing poisons on house elves his first thought it how annoyed Hermione would be. And the entire resolution to the slavery plot line is that elves enjoy being slaves. What the hell?

Rowling seems to think that just because Harry and Hermione now work for the ministry that everything is fine, when that would be impossible because the same broken systems still exist.",Why doesn’t a single character in the books care that the wizarding world is so broken and racist?,1673059585

harrypotter,"This is completely inspired by /u/[SaraSmile416] and her retelling of the Harry Potter series written from Hermione’s perspective. I am currently reading her version of Prisoner of Azkaban (which is so far, the most gripping fanfic I have ever read) and it got me thinking: what if there was an entry for each book in the series featuring a different character? I thought it might be fun to outline some of my ideas and which story elements could be included in each book. Enjoy!

Book 1: 
Ron Weasley and the Black Knight
-the troll attack
-the Mirror of Erised
-sneaking off to Hagrid’s and Norbert
-the third floor corridor
-his giant chess game 

Book 2:
Ginny Weasley and the Secret Diary
-the diary, of course
-being possessed
-encounter with the Malfoy’s
-navigating her first year classes with students in her house whom we’ve never met (such as a young Luna Lovegood?)
-her heavy crush on Harry Potter
-encounters Moaning Myrtle
-the Chamber of Secrets

Book 3:
Hermione Granger and the Time Turner
This one has already been done justice, albeit with the title, “Hermione Granger and the Prisoner of Azkaban” thanks to SaraSmile416. Her primary storyline goes into great detail on the time turner and the emotional stress it puts on Hermione as she tries to keep everything in order, as well as the toll it takes on her friendships with Harry and Ron, Ginny, and a few others (I won’t spoil too much). Seriously, read it if you like the concept!

Book 4:
Fred and George Weasley and the Faux Galleons (Idk about that title, help me!)
-Ludo Bagman storyline
-Quidditch World Cup and the death eater attack
-attempt on the Goblet of Fire
-experimenting with their joke toys and candies
-starting their Wizard Wheezes business
-witnessing/betting on the tournament
-obtaining the galleons from Harry

Book 5:
Luna Lovegood and the Veil of Mysteries
-meeting Harry Potter
-friendship with Ginny and Neville
-being an outsider in the Ravenclaw house
-the Quibbler
-joining Dumbledore’s Army
-producing a patronus
-thestrals
-adventures in the department of mysteries

Book 6:
Draco Malfoy and the Vanishing Cabinet
-father going to prison
-his task given by Voldemort
-exploring his relationship with Narcissa
-petrifying Harry on the Hogwarts Express
-attempts on Dumbledore’s life (such the necklace and the wine bottle)
-sneaking into Slughorns party
-relationship with Snape
-inner turmoil with realizing he is not the person he thought he was
-Sectumsempra curse
-Mending the cabinet

Book 7:
Neville Longbottom and the Sword of Gryffindor
-Bill and Fleur’s wedding
-going to Hogwarts under Snape as headmaster
-dealing with the Carrows
-growing as a leader and person
-friendships with Ginny and Luna
-bringing Dumbledore’s Army back
-alliance with Aberforth Dumbledore
-Luna being taken by Death eaters
-the battle of Hogwarts
-pulling the sword out of the hat

This was especially true when  she said and did awful terrible things to people in a sweet innocent voice as if she were a kindly reception teacher.

I suspect it is the vicious wickedness hidden inside visual and social cues which we normally associate with kindness which turns my stomache.

Harry’s first prediction is that he will have a risk of getting burnt, the first task involved dragons. Ron’s prediction was that he would lose something most cherished, the second task ended up, having Ron kidnapped as as Harry’s most prized possession by the influence of mercury, Mercury = merpeople. The third prediction involved Harry getting betrayed by someone he thought as a friend,this could represent two things, Viktor Krum’s betrayal in the maze, or more importantly, Mad Eye Moody’s “betrayal” in disguise by Barty Crouch Junior. Harry thought of Moody as a mentor and helper by the end. The final prediction before they continued their homework, Harry says that he will come out worse in a fight at the end.

Since I started working on it, whenever I think of Rose Weasley's character I can't imagine her being white, I don't know why, maybe because of the actress chosen in the play. So my mind totally gave birth on its own to a headcanon with Rose Granger-Weasley being adopted by Ron and Hermione, while Hugo is their biological son. And so, as a result, I imagined her inner conflict with her mother, her having to be perfect all the time because she has an inferiority complex and doesn't want to disappoint her parents' expectations, the various problems she might get into by being the only one really ""different"" in a family of redheaded white people. I don't know, now I can't get out of it. When I was drafting the outline of the story all this was not contemplated, but now every time I come back to it it seems impossible not to write it that way.

But take an all-wizard family like the Weasleys.  If any of the underage kids living in The Burrow were to do magic, it would have to be assumed that the adults were the ones doing it.

What about reactive armour with layers which would be destroyed by the unforgivables and other major spells while protecting the wearer ? Having a large amount of shrunken Shields that would be automatically unshrunken and fixed on your hand when one is destroyed ? Bludgers who are enchanted to aim incoming spells ?

Fred and George have demonstrated that enchanted clothes can be usefull for minor spells. And they only use a simple Protego enchantment, nothing more powerfull.

""Yes, of course.  We're both in here for the moment.  You know, keenness doesn't really cover it.  You might be better placed in Slytherin.  You're more ambitious than most and they could use...""

*Not Slytherin*, she practically screeched it aloud.  *They have a terrible reputation!*

""I know, child, I'm trying to do them a favor...""

*Not Slytherin!*  And doubting the hat's intentions now, *Not Ravenclaw either!*

""Damn.  GRYFFINDOR.""  Hermione put on a brave face as the hat was lifted off her head.

McGonagall pursed her lips as Neville Longbottom approached at her call a few minutes later.  She had received a couple of letters from Augusta over the holidays and wasn't encouraged.  For her part, Professor McGonagall thought the Longbottom matriarch had odd ideas about how to raise a child but, having no children of her own, couldn't be entirely certain.  She lowered the hat onto Neville's head, and it dropped right down over his eyes.

""Ho, Longbottom!  It's been a while since I last spoke to a member of your family.  Keeping well, are they?""

*Um,* Neville began.

""Never mind, boy, just breaking the ice.  Oh, dear.""  The hat paused and Neville felt the strangest sensation that there was a mind inside his head, a mind besides his own, actually looking around.  ""Oh, dear.  You poor kid.  Oh, wait...""

If asked in the moment, Neville would have described it as feeling as if some mental boxes had been shifted aside.

""You'd make a good Hufflepuff, you know.  Professor Sprout and you will get along swimmingly.""

*But my gran says Huffs are a bunch of duffers and it's probably the best i can do.*

""Your gran doesn't have the insight on you that I do,"" grumbled the hat quietly, as a few cerebral closets were opened and gently sorted.  ""Oh.  Oh!""

*What?*

""GRYFFINDOR!""

*What?  Are you sure?*

""Never been surer, kid.  Off you go, GRYFFINDOR!""

A few more students came and went with somewhat less drama, until...

""Malfoy, Draco.""

The hat came down over Malfoy's sneer as he waited for it to confidently tell him and the rest of the school what he knew was coming, but the voice inside his head surprised him.

""Hufflepuff.""

*What?!  NO!  My father will...I'm supposed to be a Slytherin, like my father!  You don't know what it's like...*

""No, lad, YOU don't know what it's like.  Huff House is full of good people from all walks of life, far more socially conscious than you are, I daresay, and you would benefit from meeting and getting to know them.  Open your eyes a little.""

*I can't!  When my father hears about this...*

""Ugh, fine.  SLYTHERIN!""

McGonagall lifted the hat and Draco rapidly readjusted his confident sneer to look a little more believable.  The hat sighed quietly to itself.",Unheard Conversations with the Sorting Hat,1673016976

harrypotter,"(nobody will read this, it's a weird post) 

Hi, I was recently playing on Potterworld (Java edition) and was intrigued by the way casting spells there works. Basically, you right click your wand and the spells appear on your hotbar. If you press Q it changes hotbar. Then, if you select the spell with a number or right click it from the inventory, the spell is selected and left clicking with the wand will cast it. 

So, I wonder if something like that is doable in MCBE world. 

I'm fully aware that some things are not doable in BE and using only commands, so I'll change something. 

First, hotbars. In BE you can use the /replaceitem just fine to make the player have a certain hotbar, so I'd use that or /give to give the player the items. However, unlike on Java, you can't save hotbars, so there's no way to know the hotbar that the player had BEFORE having the spells one selected to restore it. A solution to this might be simply having the world only for that purpose and nothing else, so the player wouldn't even have other stuff in the hotbar. 

To activate spells, I'd drop items. The dropped item would cause the spell to happen, but here's a problem:

The way that Ron and Hermione were like “oh yeah we just popped down to the chamber of secrets to grab a couple of baselisk fangs” casually like they were explaining how they went down to the shop for some beers.

The chamber of secrets can only be accessed by a parseltongue, which is a protection placed on it by slytherin himself so only his heir can be granted access. To think it could be fooled by a non parseltongue making hissing noises at it is pretty ludicrous.

Also, with the diadem, the fiend fire is set in the room of requirement and of all the attacks that could of been possibly used by crabbe(?) in that situation, he just so happened to chose the one very specific spell that can destroy horcruxes.

This wouldn’t be too much of an issue apart from the fact that so much effort and time went into finding and understanding which physical object can destroy a horcrux, and then at the very end they are like “oh actually there is a spell that can do it straight away lol”",Fiend fire and the chamber of secrets,1673005483

You can’t change things that have already happened, you can only use time turners to potentially alter the outcome of events you have no prior knowledge of. Harry and Hermione didn’t rewrite the story to change Buckbeak’s death, they simply prevented it from ever happening (but were unaware of this before they reversed time). Nobody knew Harry’s parents were going to be killed the night they were killed, or that Voldemort would become who he became, and therefore they had no reason to ever use the time turners to “prevent” those realities.

harrypotter,"As I’ve been recently replaying the Persona game series, I was thinking how much I’d love to play a character in a Hogwarts setting in that style.


For those unaware of the game mechanics, the player has a finite amount of time in the game where you play out almost every day in a calendar year. The main part of this is going to school, meeting up with your friends for various story beats, and actually doing the classes themselves. This involves certain days where the player is quizzed by the teacher or taking final exams. The character has to balance school, personal development and relationships on top of investigating murders, for example. There’s also part-time jobs to earn money outside of the “dungeon crawler” part of the game which is turn-based.


I think this desire is based on my love for Harry’s everyday school life in a magical school outside of the “saving the world” plot lines. 


I know we had some of this in the OG Harry Potter video games but it feels different when you know what quest triggers then next story progression so you know to delay it, versus active time management.","Looking forward to Legacy, however, the perfect Hogwarts game for me would be a Persona style game",1672997979

I thought of a story where they are all alive and hermione is actually Sirius’ biological daughter. Although i loves this character madly, he actually acts like an overgrown child and therefore plays his role as Harry’s godfather but doesn’t want to become a father. Hermione’s mother leaves her in front of Sirius’s house and he, against the will of the other marauders who were also willing to adopt her personally and raise her as their own daughter, decides to give her up for adoption because he doesn’t want to be her father and he didn’t want responsibility. He wanted to enjoy life as a man without problems and when he takes her in his arms for the first time at the request of the marauders he doesn’t feel that feeling that every father should feel, which James felt with Harry, but just feels an enormous weight on his shoulders but, he calls her Hermione before leaving her at the muggle orphanage because he knew a muggle name would make his mother turn in her grave and that’s why she calls herself by a short name because she didn’t want anything from the man who had left her without caring. They meets years later at the station when everyone is accompanying Harry for his first year and again when Harry invites her over to his house for the holidays having become great friends with the brilliant but silent little girl who has a morbid obsession with playing by the rules. They slowly learns more about her life and that to adopt Hermione was a horrible family that mistreats her, especially her adoptive father who punishes her whenever she doesn’t follow the rules, and then Sirius repents and tries to bond with his daughter and raise her and things like that. Obviously it will be a difficult path and Sirius will have to live with remorse but as soon as he sees her exactly as he was at her age, alone and with few friends he can really call his family, unwanted without knowing why by both of her biological parents and hated by the foster ones, he feels that feeling he hadn’t felt many years ago when he first picked her up. Hermione had his eyes, his hair, his instilled spirit rebellious and loyal to the point of error and that girl, little but strong as a lion, was his responsibility, she was a child, his child, and he had disappointed her already too much. If I weren’t so bad at writing I would do it but I leave the idea here in case someone wants to use it tell me because I would really be happy to read this fanfic.

Hermione is the daughter of Sirius and after the end of the war and discovering the truth about her father she goes back to the past to change the future, to save lives, families. She becomes friends with the Marauders, initially suspicious, even if Sirius immediately feels a strange sensation towards her, as if his world suddenly depends on the smile of a little girl who he knows very well he doesn’t love, not the way adults love themselves but the way he saw James’ parents love him, until they see Hermione’s scar. She meets her father, who died before knowing that she was his daughter, and eventually Sirius discovers that Hermione is his biological daughter from the future and for the first time in his life, this life, he had a family that was his own.","Harry Potter FanFiction idea, again, because no one thinks of me so please,pleaseeeeeeees, If anyone wants to write it, let me know.",1672964273

I mean, he had to know that it would eventually come out that Voldemort was indeed back, so how bad would it have been if Harry had gotten blamed? When it came out the Ministry would look bad for not only Denying the truth but punishing a kid for it. Plus I can't imagine the ministry would throw a child in Azkaban so Harry's punishment would be less as the ministry could just claim that Harry was a confused kid.

Instead, he takes the full blame which would have had him sent to Azkaban if he had chosen to Surender to the Minister. And the ministry uses this to undermine him. 

I guess my question is could Dumbledore have known as early as OoTP that he would be dead before Voldemort was defeated and that Harry would need the support of the wizarding world to win, and therefore take the blame to keep Harry's 'reputation' from being besmirched? or was he just shielding Harry from whatever punishment the ministry might have for him?",Did Dumbledore know he would not see the end of Voldemort,1672958491

Death Eaters have infiltrated at this point and there is  dueling everywhere. Suddenly, turning around, you see, as if in slow motion, a wall blasted apart and everywhere, your friends lay screaming and dying.

harrypotter,"While obviously I think her end goal of giving house elves fair working conditions was the right one. She was too self righteous to actually listen to what the elves themselves wanted.

And she's probably right when she says that the elves think that way because they've been conditioned to, but that doesn't change the fact that it's counter intuitive to want to force them to be free. I think that's the point Hagrid and Ron and everyone else is trying to make when they try to talk her out of it. We see that ultimately none of them agree with house elves being mistreated and enslaved, they just don't think Hermione will be able to set them free if they don't want to be free.

She got too greedy with her short and long term goals. Instead of getting them wages her short term goal probably should've been to pass legislation to ensure they're not mistreated, then hopefully elves would start realizing their value and want and seek freedom for themselves, just like it happened with Dobby. We see how fair treatment does so much to improve their lives with Dobby and Kreacher. Her long term goals should've been getting them fair wages, and it's a goal the elves themselves should help her with or want to help her with.

It's an interesting conundrum that shows that the right thing maybe obvious sometimes but that doesn't mean everyone will see that way, and that doesn't mean the solution is equally as obvious. If Hermione hadn't been so self righteous and had listened to run SPEW would've been far better received by pretty much everyone, but more importantly by the house elves themselves.",Hermione went about SPEW the wrong way,1673630600

Krishna was born in the prison cell. His uncle tried to kill him in the cell, but due to his mother's love, Krishna survived. 

That's how his uncle, Kansa, became his mortal enemy.

harrypotter,"Can we stop with this question already?! I get so tired of seeing it. It is such a ridiculous question and I don't just mean because wizards basically shun anything that is a muggle-specific invention or because they would be able to cast enchantments to protect themselves, but because it takes away from what is supposed to be a magical world. I enjoy Harry Potter because it allows me to escape into another world. Is that world perfect? Of course not. Does it have parallels to the real world? Absolutely.  

But adding guns to that world doesn't add anything to the experience. If anything it takes away from it. The worst curses in the Wizarding Universe can't just be used at will. They require intent (""You have to mean it"") to be effective. So to kill someone, you have to *want* to kill them. To torture someone you have to *want* to cause pain. I think this distinction is important because it provides more insight into the motivations and qualities of the characters. 

Harry tries to torture Bellatrix but his curse isn't successful because he's not the type of person that would want to torture someone. This distinction is what makes the characters in Harry Potter so relatable. We have all had moments where we let ourselves be ruled by our emotions, but we don't act on the thoughts we might have because that's not who we truly are and reason takes over. Adding guns to the equation would eliminate the nuances of the story and make the characters and the world incredibly one dimensional.

But knowing how to use a handgun efficiently and keeping it hidden from potential enemies, could be beneficial.  From what we know about Dark Wizards, they don't use muggle weapons.  If confronted by a dark wizard, a handgun could be a surprise towards the dark arts user.  Giving the good guys an edge.  Combing the art of wielding magic well with knowledge/wand and the advantages a handgun has.

harrypotter,"People are always on about how the films removed this and cut out that or whatever, and even me included too. I love the books and some scenes deserve to be set in the big screen, but what about things that were never in the books? And was only in the films. Just to clarify, when i mean additions, i don't mean changes. Like the film didn't add harry killing quirrel, they just changed it. And this isn't all of the things they actually added, just some of the worst i believe.

POA is widely considered like the best of the franchise, and i honestly could never see it. At best it's bad and at worst is terrible. But when thinking about it, there's one thing i usually used to overlook, and that is lupin. I never really considered about him that much, but recently i made a post about him, and it got me thinking. Why do they add him talking about lily so much? It makes no sense and it kinda feels like he had a thing for her or something, but why would he? He barely says a word about lily in the books? Comes completely out of nowhere. It's like it's a complete 180 of his character, he loves james simple as that, where was lily? Yeah, nowhere.

HBP is like the complete opposite of POA, everyone pretty much knows it sucks and yeah they're right. This film is complete doo doo. And this one has not just one bad addition but more, and one of them concerns the character of slughorn. And again, his relationship with lily. I don't know why people say they prefer his story about the fish in the film? I never really gelled with it and find it kinda dumb. Like in the books he tells about him what about happened that night his parents died, which is so much more impactful. We rarely get to even really see the truth about what happened his parents died, and in the next book we actually see it happened. And it's a shame, because it feels like it's left forgotten in the films.

But oh know HBP couldn't just help itself, and added an even dumber addition, the burning of the burrow. This one makes like absolutely no sense. Not only is not even canon, not only is it never brought up, not only does it take away one of the best highlights of the book with harry and scrimgeour in the burrow during this time in the book, we also get that stupid scene harry and ginny. It's so baffling and just completely useless. Like the next time we see the burrow, it's completely fine and is never brought up again. It's like you never fred or george be like ''ah man this shit reminds of the time the burrow burned down'' or something like that idk. And also not just that, it looks completely ugly af. The stupid ass shaky cam hurts my eyes so much and gives me chronic diarrhea.

And that brings me to another scene that also has some stupid shaky cam, and isn't in the books, that horrible chase scene in DH part 1. I honestly even forgot about this and wasn't even going to mention it, but that doesn't it mean it can get off scot free. This shit is just so like just dumb. THEY COULD EASILY JUST APPARATE AWAY! AND I CAN'T EVEN SEE WHAT'S GOING ON! AND HOW DO THE SNATCHERS EVEN FIND THEM!? WHAT! I'm sorry, i'm usually not like this when watching films, but this just is just so stupid and makes no sense at all.

And we're still on the same film, because guess what, it even get's worse. That stupid ass dance scene with harry and hermione. And before anyone says this is just some dumb shit between friends, even emma watson said in an interview, she saw this scene as like something that could happen between friends and like they both think they could be something more. And even the next scene hermione and harry look into their eyes lovingly, and even she also says ''what if we just grow old together''. And also the fact that they cut out this line, that pretty much ended the harry/hermione debate and if they would end up together:

*“After you left,” he said in a low voice, grateful for the fact that Ron’s face was hidden, “she cried for a week. Probably longer, only she didn’t want me to see. There were loads of nights when we never even spoke to each other. With you gone . . .” He could not finish; it was only now that Ron was here again that Harry fully realized how much his absence had cost them. “She’s like my sister,” he went on. “I love her like a sister and I reckon she feels the same way about me. It’s always been like that. I thought you knew.”*

I like the song they're dancing to at least, but other than that, that scene is just there to give harmione shippers some a wet dream or whatever. And it even stings ever harder because the scene before this, is quite possibly the worst scene in all of HP canon (not tcc), harry and ron's fight. This shit is so baffling and just downright idiotic. And especially the line, ''your parents are dead! YOU HAVE NO FAMILY!'' Like book ron would never outright or even come close to saying something like that, that shit is on another level of bad. It's just mind boggling the extent that these films would go to antagonize ron and demonize him, they spend all of their stupid ass camping scene montage or whatever, to facilitate that there might be something between harry and hermione and ooh ron's jealous or whatever. It's useless they're just building up for this stupid fight for half the movie and it's just a complete joke. It's like it's memed so much to the point where it really is a joke at this point. I hate this scene with all my heart, and yeah maybe it's a changed scene, but the entire point of the fight is different from the book, and the film just again, makes up some dumbass BS.

That's all i could remember honestly, there might be alot more. Just to be clear, i'm not saying an adaptation shouldn't add nothing or whatever, should stick 100% to it? Nah, where's the fun in that. But just adding dumbass shit and making up complete nonsense like these examples, isn't any better. In my next post i do want to discuss a scene where i think the films do something right, by actually adding something that wasn't in the book.

harrypotter,"Upon a current reread of the series, I find similarities between Harry Potter and Hindu Mythology. At the same time, Rowling pulled elements from the Christian mythos for her books and some from other myths. Some parts of the series speak to me as an Indian reading the series. Let me start with the apparent similarities between the story elements of Harry Potter and famous Indian mythological stories. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Prophecy that Harry must kill Voldemort bares similarities to the story in the Bhagavatam of how an evil king named Kansa received a premonition that the eighth nephew of his would be his killer. While in Harry's case, it was the same except with Voldemort, and how did the two react? 

&amp;#x200B;

Kansa went on a murder spree, killing seven of his nephews before the eighth, a reincarnation of Lord Vishnu himself, and escaped his clutches in the form of Krishna, and Voldemort began targeting the Potters. While in Harry's case, something similar happens when he destroys Voldemort as a baby for the time being, losing his parents in the process. While this is one of the more apparent similarities I have noticed, the trope of a chosen hero or chosen one is quite common in stories.  

&amp;#x200B;

The second thing that struck me was the same scenario in the Mahabharat that led to the death of a famous warrior called Abimanyu was almost the same as the maze in the fourth book. The first is that Harry, like Abimanyu, had to cross a maze to reach the centre of it. In both cases, they found themselves fighting for their lives while no one else could see what was transpiring inside the maze. Finally, both cases ended with some form of tragic circumstances, with Harry's being that he saw Cedric Diggory get killed and Voldemorts return, and Abimanyu lost his life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, Dumbledore's character and Voldemorts resemble the characters of Shakuni and Lord Krishna from the Mahabharata. Especially both are the only ones that can counter the other schemes and plans. Eventually, leading to the death of the other; however, in Dumbledore's case, he dies trying to bring down Voldemort. At the same time, Dumbledore's death and the fall of Bhisma, the grandsire of the dynasty that is the centre of the Mahabharata, are almost the same.

&amp;#x200B;

 Given that many people stop to grieve the loss of both, at the same time, Dumbledore being unable to stop the rise of Voldemort for the second time is an uncanny similarity to how Bhisma was unable to stop the war that is the centrepiece of an Indian epic called the Mahabharata from happening.

harrypotter,"before you say no, of course not, look at the scene:

&gt;As Dumbledore spoke, Harry heard a rustle behind him and rather‬ thought Kingsley whispered something. He could have sworn too that‬ he felt something brush against his side, a gentle something like a‬ draft or bird wings, but looking down he saw nothing there.‬
…
&gt;‪“Miss Edgecombe,” said Umbridge at once, “tell us how long these‬ ‪meetings have been going on, dear. You can simply nod or shake your‬ ‪head, I’m sure that won’t make the spots worse. Have they been happening regularly over the last six months?”‬ Harry felt a horrible plummeting in his stomach. This was it, they‬ ‪had hit a dead end of solid evidence that not even Dumbledore would be able to shift aside…‬
…
‪&gt;Everyone in the room was gazing at the top of Marietta’s face. Only‬ ‪her eyes were visible between the pulled up robes and her curly fringe.‬ ‪Perhaps it was a trick of the firelight, but her eyes looked oddly blank.‬
‪&gt;And then — to Harry’s utter amazement — Marietta shook her head.‬
‪&gt;Umbridge looked quickly at Fudge and then back at Marietta.‬ ‪“I don’t think you understood the question, did you, dear? I’m asking whether you’ve been going to these meetings for the past six‬ ‪months? You have, haven’t you?”‬
‪&gt;Again, Marietta shook her head.‬
‪“What do you mean by shaking your head, dear?” said Umbridge‬ ‪in a testy voice.‬
&gt;‪“I would have thought her meaning was quite clear,” said Professor‬ ‪McGonagall harshly. “There have been no secret meetings for the past‬ ‪six months. Is that correct, Miss Edgecombe?”‬
‪&gt;Marietta nodded.‬
&gt;‪“But there was a meeting tonight!” said Umbridge furiously.‬ ‪“There was a meeting, Miss Edgecombe, you told me about it, in the‬ ‪Room of Requirement! And Potter was the leader, was he not, Potter‬ ‪organized it, Potter — why are you shaking your head, girl?”‬
&gt;‪“Well, usually when a person shakes their head,” said McGonagall‬ ‪coldly, “they mean ‘no.’ So unless Miss Edgecombe is using a form of‬ ‪sign language as yet unknown to humans—”‬
‪&gt;Professor Umbridge seized Marietta, pulled her around to face her,‬ ‪and began shaking her very hard.‬
…
&gt; ‪Marietta was standing exactly where Umbridge had released her.‬ ‪She seemed neither perturbed by Umbridge’s sudden attack, nor relieved by her release. She was still clutching her robe up to her oddly‬ ‪blank eyes, staring straight ahead of her. A sudden suspicion connected to Kingsley’s whisper and the thing he had felt shoot past him‬ ‪sprang into Harry’s mind.‬

(this is copied and paraphrased a bit from ch27. i hope my mobile formatting is okay.)

now, i always assumed that he’d confunded her. perhaps even obliviated her. but on a recent reread, i realized that a confundus charm’s purpose is to *confuse.* it does not make you do what the caster wants you to or believe what they want you to believe, unless they instruct you verbally perhaps (we never see this happen, but it’s implied by snape in PoA and DH when he uses the confundus as a reason to discredit people that you can use it to convince someone of incorrect information). so why is marietta shaking her head here, rather than agreeing with umbridge? why is she so blank and docile and nonreactive?

harry gets “a suspicion” as to what’s been cast, indicating he finds this behaviour familiar, recognizable. at this point, he has never seen anyone confunded. i checked with potter-search.com and at that point, the confundus has only been referenced: by snape in PoA, and by barty in GoF. the first time we see someone confunded on-page is mclaggen in HBP: he goes “lumbering off in the wrong direction” and is confused and stumbling about knocking into things for the rest of the day. he doesn’t lose awareness. nothing like marietta, who’s not confused at all. she’s calm and cooperative. harry saw plenty of that in “moody’s” defense class in GoF.

harrypotter,"Me and my friend got in an argument about if they were to create a new harry potter franchise about his children it would do anywhere near as good, she was saying it would as harry potter is such an iconic movie franchise and it would be amazing to continue the story which is a good opinion but if she would listen to my opinion she would see why i dont think it would do anywhere near as good as the original, here it is

Harry potter has some of the best selling books of all time, something like that is hard to compare to, especially when there are hundreds and hundred of other books extremely well made that dont even come close, sure its harry potter and that but when you think of ""harry potter"" you think of Daniel Radcliffe, not harry potters kids, its just become so iconic and well chiseld into our brains a new franchise would be overlooked and wouldnt be able to compare.

My second reasoning is what story would there be to tell, she says its gonna be about the aftermath and people really want to see it but the story kinda ended at that moment, it would be hard to introduce a new villain as there are not really any others mentioned and it wouldnt be very creative, sure there are other worlds in the wizarding universe but why not just make a new story not a hp one.

My last reason is targeted audience, it would be very hard to do as older people or anyone above 10 really would find the original franchise to be to good and nostalgic to be surpassed and the newer generations with the world is advancing would be alot more put off because of jk being transphobic which caused massive backlash

harrypotter,"I don't have a bad opinion of Slytherin house. I can find the given value in every Hogwarts house. In Ravenclaw, for example, knowledge, the desire to know and the love of science. In Hufflepuff, honesty, integrity and honor. In Gryffindor, determination, courage, strength and loyalty. And in the Slytherin house, cunning, ingenuity, ambition, willingness to act and dedication.

I respect all houses equally, but I feel that for some reason the Slytherin house is considered by many people to be the worst and most evil house to belong to. After all, those malicious and evil people who basically do not even deserve the epithet ""human"" end up in this house. Perhaps they are not worthy of being placed in another Hogwarts house based on their own limitations, cowardice, weakness, stupidity and evil and malicious violent, psychopaths behavior. In this way, they spoil the Slytherin reputation and everyone identifies the Slytherin house with these people.

(I have often wondered why there isn't a fifth house, where the useless, incapable of living, or the evil and perverted good-for-nothings are assigned? The name of this house could be MOSGLAMACH. From Old Irish MOSACH; shaggy, rough, bristly bristly, grumpy, surly. And from SGLAMHACH - hungry dog or mastiff - and the animal of the house could be a mad dog with a foaming mouth.)

People with weak abilities, or possibly characterless and infinitely evil people (who are not suitable for any other Hogwarts house due to their inability to live and their inferior character) are just an afterthought.

Apart from them, the Slytherin house could be just as worthy of respect and honor as the other houses. Because not only vile and inferior people came from this house. E.g. Severus Snape - whom I don't think I need to introduce to anyone (I'd rather describe him as a misunderstood, tragic hero), Narcissa Malfoy, who didn't tell Voldemort that Harry Potter was alive, Regulus Black, who was the first to confront Voldemort by stealing his horcrux, or Horace Slughorn - one of my personal favorite characters - who was an extremely utilitarian and calculating man, yet still helped in the fight against Voldemort.

However, there is something about Slytherin house that I still can't wrap my head around to this day. That is, how could a supposedly ""wise wizard"" who is one of the founders of Hogwarts be able to leave a monster for posterity whose task is to destroy innocent children - just because they are ""mudbloods""? I've also read a theory that Salazar did this to protect wizards from traitors who might betray them to the ""muggle inquisitors"" and possibly tell them all the secrets of wizarding society. But I think it's extremely drastic and rude to unleash a Basilisk-level monster on ignorant and innocent children - who know nothing and want no harm. 

This act of Slytherin Salazar basically defined his personality, and it is why everyone considers the Slytherin house to be the most despised house - at least among those who do not belong to it. (E.g.: Everyone at Hogwarts was always cheering against for Slytherin - especially in the Quidditch matches and every Hogwarts houses hated the Slytherin house.) 

The problem is that there is no concrete explanation in the books as to why the founder of the Slytherin house was a potential child killer - which is almost the same level of evil as Voldemort.",What drove Slytherin Salazar to become a child killer and establish Slytherin's bad reputation for generations?,1673538328
harrypotter,"So I’m home sick for the next week and I’m absolutely miserable and in a lot of pain and looking for well-written HP fics. I’ve read the entire series, (a few times over the years) and I’ve just finished the movies, again, day before yesterday.

What I tried to find yesterday, was honestly well-written fanfic that continues the story after Deathly Hallows.

It plays a huge part in Deathly Hallows, but I can't remember if this rule is exclusive to the Elder Wand. If it's a rule for all wands, then it'd be pure chaos. Witches and wizards would be constantly trying to regain the trust of their wand; disarming whoever disarmed them, in an endless cycle of revenge dueling.

For instance, did Snape ever regain ownership of his own wand from Hermione after what happened in the Shrieking Shack?

harrypotter,"My girlfriend and I are visiting New York City this weekend and she brought up the idea of seeing grabbing some cheaper last minute tickets to Cursed Child on Broadway. 

A couple years ago I listened to the audiobook of Cursed Child on a long lonely road trip and I honestly didn’t hate it! I didn’t think it was great and had some wtf moments, but as I was driving alone in the dark I was happy to be back in this world. My girlfriend hasn’t read the script or seen the play so everything will be fresh to her. I see it’s now a slimmed down 3 hour show so that has peaked my interest. While it’s hard to find anything positive about Cursed Child on the internet, every review I’ve seen of the stage show has said it’s fantastic, the visuals are stunning and well worth it.

Harry Potter has played a massive role in both our lives and our relationship. I have an extreme case of Dyslexia and the Harry Potter books are what got me to learn to read. As I grew older, Harry learning to cope with his alienation from his peers helped me to cope with the alienation I was feeling. The last couple of years have renewed my interest in the series, turning to the books for solace to help find comfort to confront the adult world. So yes, this series means a lot to me and if this is my one chance to see anything Harry Potter in person, I don’t think it’s something to pass up.

It will also be fitting because I remember I was sitting outside by myself in New York City when I was around 11 or 12 years old when I finished reading Deathly Hallows and was a defining moment of my life. That moment was the first time I really felt myself growing up.

Proof from canon that Ron is a terrible friend.

1. Ron is rude. In Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, when Ron first meets Harry, he asks Harry if he really has the scar and stares at Harry's scar, making Harry uncomfortable.
2. Ron is insensitive. After the Levitation Charm lesson in Sorcerer's Stone, Ron talks mean about Hermione behind her back and makes her go cry in the bathroom. And, no, it wasn't something Ron said to Harry in private, Ron made his mean comments about Hermione in a crowded corridor.
3. Ron approves of murder. In Chamber of Secrets, while discussing why Riddle might have gotten an award for Special Services to the School, Ron says ""maybe he murdered Myrtle, that would have done everyone a favor. So Ron is actually Draco like.
4. Ron has misplaced priorities. In Prisoner of Azkaban, Ron commits the sin of caring more about a pet than a friend. The bottom line is that the falling out between Ron and Hermione in Prisoner of Azkaban is Ron's fault. The reason it is Ron's fault is because of how inappropriately he handled the initial disappearance of Scabbers. Ron was absolutely in the wrong to shake bedsheets in Hermione's face and yell at her in one of the most public settings of Hogwarts, the Gryffindor Common Room. Ron later meanly freezes Hermione out of the food party in the Gryffindor Common Room after their Quidditch win over Ravenclaw. When Harry tries to help Hermione, he yells again and makes poor Hermione run off crying. When confronted by Harry by this, Ron unfairly says ""If she just acted like she was sorry"" The problem with this is that Ron had no right to expect an apology from Hermione for anything unless and until he first apologized to her for shaking bedsheets in her face, yelling at her, and humiliating her in front of the whole common room. Personally, the ONLY way I will EVER apologize to anyone for anything is if the person who feels wronged by me informs me of how they feel they've been wronged by me in a 100% calm, 100% polite, 100% classy, 100% non yelling, and 100% non in your face manner. If someone yells at me, humiliates me, gets in my face, and shakes materials in my face, I will NEVER apologize to them for anything even if it is an indisputable truism that I owe them an apology unless and until they first apologize to me for the yelling, humiliation, in your faceness, etc. Bare in mind that being humiliated is a MUCH worse position to be in than the position Ron was in. Then, later on, Ron won't listen to Hagrid when Hagrid gives his correct perspective that Ron should value his friend more than rats. Remember: FRIENDS SHOULD ALWAYS BE VALUED ABOVE PETS! NO EXCEPTIONS!. Even minor level friendships such as Harry Potter and Katie Bell should always be valued above pets. Harry should care MUCH more about Katie than about Hedwig. Since Ron and Hermione are actually close friends, it's MUCH more true that Ron should care far more about Hermione than about Scabbers. The caveat is this: If Ron would have approached Hermione in a classy and polite manner and informed her of what he thought had happened and what his evidence was in a classy and polite manner, he would then have been justified in expecting an apology from Hermione. Here's what Ron should have done: He should have left the bedsheets in the dorm, calmly approached Hermione in the common room, and asked her for a word. He should then have asked her to follow him up to his dorm and talked to her in private. He then should have showed Hermione the bedsheets and cat hairs and explained that Scabbers was gone and that the evidence pointed to Crookshanks eating Scabbers without yelling. Had Ron handled the situation this way and Hermione still completely denied that the evidence pointed to Crookshanks eating Scabbers, Ron would have been MUCH more justified in becoming angry with Hermione after that. But, Ron needed to understand that no one is going to apologize for anything if you yell at them, humiliate them, or shake materials in their face. Acting like that is only going to rile people up and make people angry and defensive. Being yelled at will also freak most people out. While ""friends should always be valued above pets"" is a hill I will forever die on, I would have MUCH more respect for the opinion that Hermione should have apologized to Ron if Ron himself had handled himself in a classy manner like he should have.
5. Ron is untrusting. Ron falls out with Harry in Goblet of Fire because he doesn't doesn't trust Harry enough. After knowing him for three plus years, Ron should know Harry well enough both to know that he would never have put his own name in the Goblet of Fire knowing the extra attention that would bring as Harry hated fame and attention AND that Harry would NEVER go behind his back or exclude him. Ron knows Harry well enough that he should have trusted Harry and not been suspicious of him. If I were Harry Potter, I would never have forgiven Ron for this betrayal and would never have had anything to do with him ever again. After the 1st Task, Harry should have removed Ron from his life and fully embraced his friendship with Hermione, who proved through her loyalty and support after Harry's name came out of the Goblet of Fire that she and not Ron was Harry's true Bestie. If Harry needed more than one best friend he should have become closer with Neville, Ginny, or Luna. Always remember that it is an indisputable truism that Ron was 1000% unjustified in not supporting, not believing, and not trusting Harry here. Always remember that it is an indisputable truism that this falling out was 100% Ron's fault and 0% Harry's fault. Harry literally didn't do anything wrong and Ron had NO legitimate justification for not supporting, believing, and trusting Harry more here.
6. In Order of the Phoenix, Ron is rude to first years in his prefect duty and calls them midgets.
7. In Half Blood Prince, Ron rudely takes an armchair by fire from an innocent first year. (Hermione does the right thing and gives the armchair back to the first year.)
8. Ron is observed to be unkind by Luna. On page 310 of Half Blood Prince, Luna says that Ron is unkind and that she had noticed that last year. Consider the fact that lovely and awesome Luna feels no affection for Ron and thinks him unkind.
9. In Half Blood Prince, Ron is mean to his Quidditch teammates and makes Demzela cry.
10. The worst part of all: Ron is disloyal. Ron literally betrayed and abandoned both Harry and Hermione on the road in the middle of a WAR. When you betray and abandon your two best friends on the road in the middle of a WAR, then you are NOT loyal but are a fair weather friend. You can't blame the Horcrux because both Harry and Hermione were it is well and neither of them ever abandoned each other or the mission. You also can't blame hunger. Neither Harry nor Hermione had any more to eat than Ron did. You can't blame conditions either. Harry and Hermione didn't have any comfortable beds or anything any more than Ron did. Even in general, Harry and Hermione had better attitudes toward the Horcrux Hunt than Ron and both did far less worrying and whining than Ron did. Harry was right on the money when he said that Ron knew he signed up for. Ron knew that the Horcrux Hunt wasn't going to be flowers and chocolates. This was the moment that made Ron 1000% irredeemable and proved for good that Hermione and not Ron was Harry's true Bestie and truly loyal friend. Ron literally betrayed and abandoned both Harry and Hermione on the road in the middle of a WAR. When the going got tough, Ron got going and ditched his friends. That's a fair weather friend for you.

harrypotter,"Hello friends. So you know how in the Prisoner of Azkaban movie (especially the first dementor scene on the train to Hogwarts) the screen effect symbolizing the dementor stealing the soul of a person? I am of the opinion that, compared to some of the amazing videography of POA, this was a really poor representation of the effect. 

On the other hand, Sirius laying by the lake at the end of the movie and the soul-mass(?) temporarily exiting/reentering his body was absolutely fantastic. I just really didn't care for the blurry screen effect; it just doesn't seem like the right way to animate it to me.  However, at the same time, I'm not the type of person to ordinarily complain without trying to come up with a better solution and honestly nothing immediately occurs to me as a better portrayal method.

This is a very niche conversation exclusively pertaining to the POA movie's portrayal of the dementors attempting to suck out a person's soul / feeding on a person.

I know that book vs. movie discussion threads are extremely common, and one thing I have noticed is that a lot of people will also discuss how the changes that were made to the movies affected how they felt about a particular character's death as opposed to how they felt when they read the books.  Now, while many people have expressed that the movies lessened the impact of some characters' deaths for them, I am wondering if there are any instances where the movies might have heightened the impact of a character's death.

Personally, I noticed that Hedwig's death actually hit me harder when I watched *Deathly Hallows: Part 1* as opposed to when I read her death in the book.  There's just something about my favorite Snowy Owl's dying while actively trying to protect Harry (movie death) as opposed to dying while sitting in a cage (book death) that caused me to lose more tears while watching the movie versus while reading the book.

harrypotter,"During the scenes going back to the Triwizard Tournament, it cuts to the Ludo Bagman commentary that was happening in the background of Goblet of Fire. In that, we get this:

&gt;If you’re from Hogwarts. Give me a cheer.

&gt;*There’s a loud cheer*

&gt;If you’re from Durmstrang — give me a cheer

&gt;*There’s a loud cheer*

&gt;AND IF YOU’RE FROM BEAUXBATONS GIVE ME A CHEER

&gt;*There’s a slightly limp cheer*

I’m unsure whether it was just an abysmal attempt at humour in Fleur doing poorest in the tasks, or if the writers genuinely thought there were less people there from Beaxbatons. 

Just to give perspective, Beaxbatons is stated to have a far bigger castle than both Hogwarts and Durmstrang. While some of that might just be for show, you have to take into consideration that ,unlike Hogwarts, Beaxbaton’s general population isn’t only from one country as they house wizards from numerous Central European countries surrounding France. 

Granted, I imagine it’s similar with Durmstrang, but they certainly wouldn’t give off a “limp cheer”.

harrypotter,"A lot of people like to criticize Yates for his work but I personally thought he was one of the better directors for Potter. Im speaking about only his 4 Potter films as I think the FB films weren’t consistent or coherent enough as a story. 

When I look at Yates’s work, I think of camera moving and imagery storytelling. His films, outside of Alfonso Cuaron, felt the most cinematic and emotional of any in the series. In most of his films, he gets great performances from the actors and always has this gritty tone to the films that were needed for the back half of the series. His adaptations were decent but I attribute that to the lack of runtime in the film(s). Him and Steve Kloves had great chemistry together in my opinion. 

If David Yates was around given the option to direct Goblet of Fire, a far better narrative than Order of Phoenix imo, I’m sure we would’ve gotten a more darker and tonally consistent film that Newell’s Goblet of Fire. 

•The Death eater attack would’ve been a little longer. 

•The Dragon chase would be significantly toned down or removed 

•The 3rd task would’ve included more creatures and jump scares for the audience.

harrypotter,"I've read all the books multiple times and watched the movies too. But I just cannot sit through a re- watch of the film series. It's sooo boring.

I see so many posts of people saying that they go back to the movies to feel good, to feel at home, to be comforted. I don't feel that way.

I need at least a year between two watches of the series. For instance, last time I finished a HP movie marathon was 2 months ago and yesterday I went back to the sorcerer's stone and got bored very soon. I forced myself and kept watching till the ""you're a wizard, harry"" scene and then I just had to stop.

I've observed that over the years I've started to dislike the movies more and more.
The first two movies are good imo but the later parts - especially 4th(GTH Mike Newell),5th,6th- ugh!! They feel very badly adapted and have lost the charm for me.

I love the books and could easily go back to the 1st book right after finishing a reading marathon. But that's just not the case with the movies anymore. idk..

Anyone else feels this way ? or am I alone?

P.S. I am a LOTR fan as well. I've been a LOTR fan for many years. And I absolutely love the extended editions of it's movies. They're glorious pieces of cinema that I keep going back to every other month. Something that won't happen with the HP movies now.",Unpopular opinion- I don't like the movies so much.,1673458415
harrypotter,"Considering the reception to the fandom to the recent rumors, regarding a possible reboot of the series, I was wondering which would be the best way to keep the Wizarding World going, not counting a reboot of the movies, nor a reboot as a TV series, which is one of the most common suggestions, but which also seems to be pretty divisise by a part of the fandom, which considers it's too early for a reboot.

Personally, I think Warner should do what they seem to be already testing with Hogwarts Legacy: use Hogwarts, but in a different context. If Hogwarts Legacy works, I can see them creating a TV series taking place in Hogwarts, possibly also taking place in a different time period. Maybe the first season could be during Hogwarts's foundation and start from there, with the founders, as the heads of their respective houses, helping Hogwarts studying deal with their struggles, while also dealing with their own struggles.

They could just call it ""Hogwarts"", or, if they want to make the fandom happier, maybe they could call it ""Hogwarts: A History"".

But that's just my opinion. What would you be more inclined to see?

harrypotter,"11 January 2023 - In recent years, the wizarding world has seen a steady increase in international trade and commerce, but sources now suggest that this trend is slowing down.

The Ministry of Magic has reported a decrease in the number of import and export licenses issued for wizarding goods and services, indicating a downturn in international trade. This has caused concern among many in the wizarding community, as international trade has become a crucial aspect of the wizarding economy.

Businesses that rely heavily on international trade, such as the magical instrument industry and the potion-making industry, have reported a significant drop in profits. Many merchants have been forced to lay off workers and reduce production as a result of the decrease in demand for their products.

Experts attribute the slowdown in international trade to several factors, including increasing regulations and tariffs imposed by the Ministry of Magic, as well as tensions between different wizarding nations. Some have also pointed to the ongoing war in the Middle East, which has affected trade routes and made it more difficult for merchants to transport goods.

The Ministry of Magic has assured the wizarding community that they are taking steps to address the issue, but many businesses and individuals are calling for more drastic measures to be taken to boost international trade.

In a similar fashion, in Prisoner of Askaban, Harry has to face the book’s challenge with only Hermione, having to leave Ron behind. And finally, in Goblet of Fire, Harry faces the challenge completely alone; showing the growth Harry had to go through from  books 1-4.

harrypotter,"It's pretty common to talk about how Voldemort has chopped up his soul into a bunch of tiny pieces, and how little he would have left- but I think people have missed quite how bad it is.

As I'm sure many remember, you don't just split your soul when you make a Horcrux- you split it when you murder someone in cold blood, as Slughorn tells Riddle here:

&gt;By an act of evil — the supreme act of evil. By committing murder.  
&gt;  
&gt;Killing rips the soul apart. The wizard intent upon creating a Horcrux would  
&gt;  
&gt;use the damage to his advantage: He would encase the torn portion —”

If we take that entirely at face value, things aren't looking very good for Tom's soul. 

Looking at the number of Inferi in the lake, then let's take 150 as the minimum he killed and 1000 as the maximum. Seems about fair. Then, *at best*, he'll have 151-1001 individual pieces of soul. But it's not quite so simple.

In order to find our real answer, we have to decide how a soul tears (though, in sincerity, I *soul-*ly doubt it's meant to be treated so mathematically). Since there's no way with each given murder to know the total number of murders in the future, there's no reason to split an even piece of each time. So likely no perfect 151-1001 part soul. 

If, each time, a chunk just comes off like a sandwich crumb, then he's probably got a bunch of tiny super mini soul bits floating about. Great to resurrect yourself with those.

But. If it's actually cutting off a half each time, and assuming that each half won't be spared future halving in the future, then after 150 murders he'll have 2\^150,  or seventy quattuordecillion (!!!), individual pieces of soul. 7•10\^46. And if it's 1000 murders, then it'll be in almost a centillion, or \~9•10\^302 different parts. Soooooooo yeah. Big numbers. Very big numbers.

That does seem to explain why his soul was so unstable he made a whole accidental Horcrux.

* Voldemort loses a half each time he makes a Horcrux, but murder alone doesn't split his soul in two. Then, he's only got 1/256th remaining.
* Voldemort plans ahead and manages to put about 1/7th in each intentional Horcrux. He still probably ends up splitting the final seventh with Harry, since he gave it up by accident, meaning he and Harry each get 1/14th.
* Peter Pettigrew, when resurrecting him, draws some substantial fraction off of all the Horcruxes, giving him actually a decent restart point.
* Voldemort's soul is no longer a single entity but a sickly buzzing hive of barely connected parts, which no horrible act is even able to damage more.

harrypotter,"Dobby, is practically everyone's favorite character, yet he really gets the short end of the stick in the films. It's like so annoying, and the real reason i could see why they cut him out of the following films we'll discuss, is because they really didn't know any better, or better yet didn't know he would become such a huge and important character later down the line. But is that actually true? By the time the GOF film came out, it was 2005, and the GOF, OOTP, and HBP book already released, and dobby is a prominent character there as well. And when 2007 came about, the books ended and only the OOTP film came out, so why couldn't they have included him in the films before? Is it because they think he's some useless character or something? It's stupid. 

**The Chamber Of Secrets**

Yes, his first appearance to the franchise, really doesn't stick out much. He really just like barely shows up in the film, just in the beginning, middle, and end. Not really much to say here, because even in the book like what does he do? The only thing that really sticks out, is his love of harry tbh. He's so devoted and loyal to him even though he's not even his master, they honestly seem like really good friends, but none of that is really translated in the films tbh. Harry just seems like he doesn't give 2 shits about dobby, and ofc this will become much more apparent later, but even here it feels hfbr3bf yk. 

I also want to talk about his design, and yeah it looks...ugly af. Like i get he's a house elf what more was i expecting, but his design just looks like a wrinkled nutsack tbh. And it's shame they don't have his round glassy tennis ball eyes or whatever. 

Lucius pretty much kills harry and the end of the film, and this is the last we see of dobby, until his eventual demise, but i don't care because he still shows up in the books.

**The Goblet Of Fire**

I remember a while back of something i saw on youtube i think, but it was an easter egg of the GOF film, and in a split second shot you could make it out dobby and winky, during the quidditch world cup scene. And it just makes it even worse why they didn't show up. And i think maybe that's why they didn't want to add dobby? Because they didn't want to have winky? Or something idk i'm really grasping at straws. And it's even more baffling because winky is a great character. Yeah, sure she's an alcoholic mess, but she's really like the driving force for hermione's S.P.E.W obsession and movement. And this scene really shows it.

 *“You may rest assured that she will be punished,” Mr. Crouch added coldly. “M-m-master . . .” Winky stammered, looking up at Mr. Crouch, her eyes brimming with tears. “M-m-master, p-p-please . . .” Mr. Crouch stared back, his face somehow sharpened, each line upon it more deeply etched. There was no pity in his gaze. “Winky has behaved tonight in a manner I would not have believed possible,” he said slowly. “I told her to remain in the tent. I told her to stay there while I went to sort out the trouble. And I find that she disobeyed me. This means clothes.” “No!” shrieked Winky, prostrating herself at Mr. Crouch’s feet. “No, master! Not clothes, not clothes!” Harry knew that the only way to turn a house-elf free was to present it with proper garments. It was pitiful to see the way Winky clutched at her tea towel as she sobbed over Mr. Crouch’s feet. “But she was frightened!” Hermione burst out angrily, glaring at Mr. Crouch. “Your elf ’s scared of heights, and those wizards in masks were levitating people! You can’t blame her for wanting to get out of their way!” Mr. Crouch took a step backward, freeing himself from contact with the elf, whom he was surveying as though she were something filthy and rotten that was contaminating his over-shined shoes. “I have no use for a house-elf who disobeys me,” he said coldly, looking over at Hermione. “I have no use for a servant who forgets what is due to her master, and to her master’s reputation.”*  

She plays such a huge part in the whole crouch storyline, which IMO is really where this book shines. And yes ik this is about dobby, but it feels weird to not at least mention her, because then again, it was because of him she even got a job. But in this book we really see the relationship of him and harry building stronger, especially with the gillyweed.

Okay listen...i get why they cut out him actually giving it, and having neville do it instead, because it made more sense...but it's not like the films made that shit up. That was his original plan in the first place, he wanted harry to ask neville about gillyweed but that failed so he used dobby instead...so why couldn't they just do that instead too? It's like it's the little things that make harry and dobby special yk, even him giving him the stupid sweater he made for him, that's just cute. And even just the fact that again he risked his neck just to help harry, is even better. 

**The Order Of The Phoenix**

Okay replacing dobby with neville last time you had a pass, doing it again nah that's taking it too far. It's like why? Just why? It's so stupid and leaves dobby doing nothing and not even show up in the entire film. And not even just the fact that he doesn't find the room of requirement, nah they take it a step further, and not have him warn harry about umbridge.

 *But he thought he knew — surely only one “she” could induce such fear in Dobby? The elf looked up at him, slightly cross-eyed, and mouthed wordlessly. “Umbridge?” asked Harry, horrified. Dobby nodded, then tried to bang his head off Harry’s knees; Harry held him at bay. “What about her? Dobby — she hasn’t found out about this — about us — about the D.A.?” He read the answer in the elf’s stricken face. His hands held fast by Harry, the elf tried to kick himself and fell to the floor. “Is she coming?” Harry asked quietly. Dobby let out a howl, and began beating his bare feet hard on the floor. “Yes, Harry Potter, yes!” Harry straightened up and looked around at the motionless, terrified people gazing at the thrashing elf. “WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?” Harry bellowed. “RUN!” They all pelted toward the exit at once, forming a scrum at the door, then people burst through; Harry could hear them sprinting along the corridors and hoped they had the sense not to try and make it all the way to their dormitories. It was only ten to nine, if they just took refuge in the library or the Owlery, which were both nearer — “Harry, come on!” shrieked Hermione from the center of the knot of people now fighting to get out. He scooped up Dobby, who was still attempting to do himself serious injury, and ran with the elf in his arms to join the back of the queue. “Dobby — this is an order — get back down to the kitchen with the other elves, and if she asks you whether you warned me, lie and say no!” said Harry. “And I forbid you to hurt yourself!” he added, dropping the elf as he made it over the threshold at last and slamming the door behind him. “Thank you, Harry Potter!” squeaked Dobby, and he streaked off.*  

This is even dumber because now in the film, the entire D.A gets in trouble, whereas in the book they all got off totally unharmed. Which even brings us to very next scene in the film, where they're in dumbledore's office and completely ruin that too. I'm sorry, i'm getting off track the OOTP film is the bane of my existence, and it ruined dobby so it's even worse now.

But oh wait, like GOF this film could't get enough of ruining just one house elf, so they ruined another one...kreacher. I love the fact that harry actually goes to kreacher and asks him if sirius betrayed him, and he doesn't look like a complete idiot for not actually going to check...UNLIKE IN THE FILM! WHERE HE IS. Kreacher is like the complete opposite of dobby, having no respect sirius and pretty much hating his guts. And i understand, he really was the living embodiment of everything he hated with his family's pureblood mania. And even his betrayal is such a crazy ass plot twist, and makes sirius dying even so much more gut-wrenching. And i know this about dobby, but it plays in here too, by removing the character it makes their death much less impactful. Hence, dobby in DH. His death feels unearned and downright cheap and pretty much useless, because all that build-up we had of him and harry's friendship growing and growing over the course of the series, is just completely gone. And at times it also makes him an idiot, like not asking kreacher in the fire about sirius in the film AND...

**The Half-Blood Prince**

Not telling dobby to spy on malfoy. It's literally right there dude, you're so close. Yes, it's not established he even works in hogwarts, but guess what aberforth still called him in malfoy manor, so idk. And i find it hilarious that this homeboy really beat the living hell out of kreacher, and broke some of his teeth because he was talking shit about harry, that's just dedication. 

And that's pretty much all he does for this book...so maybe i'll be lenient and i'll give the film a pass for him cutting him here.

**The Deathly Hallows**

But now reach the penultimate end of whatever idk. Because the films pull a complete 180 and actually include him in the film...YAY but not really. It just feels really rushed and like they're trying to cram in all the missed character moments we had from the books all into 1 scene and it just fails completely, rendering his death scene just completely butchered.

This is honestly one of the best death scenes of the entire series, and it's done beautifully in the book.

 *“Dobby — no — HELP!” Harry bellowed toward the cottage, toward the people moving there. “HELP!”  He did not know or care whether they were wizards or Muggles, friends or foes; all he cared about was that a dark stain was spreading across Dobby’s front, and that he had stretched out his thin arms to Harry with a look of supplication. Harry caught him and laid him sideways on the cool grass. “Dobby, no, don’t die, don’t die —” The elf’s eyes found him, and his lips trembled with the effort to form words. “Harry . . . Potter . . .” And then with a little shudder the elf became quite still, and his eyes were nothing more than great glassy orbs, sprinkled with light from the stars they could not see.* 

Deathly hallows is already a complete bonkers book, with deaths flying left and right and centre, yet dobby's one really just feels like it came out of nowhere and unexpected, and that really adds to the scene rather than take away. I still remember reading the book for one of the first times, and his death really hit me super hard. Like i was literally bawling my eyes out damn. And what's even sadder than him just dying is the scene with his funeral. “

*''There,” she said softly. “Now he could be sleeping.” Harry placed the elf into the grave, arranged his tiny limbs so that he might have been resting, then climbed out and gazed for the last time upon the little body. He forced himself not to break down as he remembered Dumbledore’s funeral, and the rows and rows of golden chairs, and the Minister of Magic in the front row, the recitation of Dumbledore’s achievements, the stateliness of the white marble tomb. He felt that Dobby deserved just as grand a funeral, and yet here the elf lay between bushes in a roughly dug hole. “I think we ought to say something,” piped up Luna. “I’ll go first, shall I?” And as everybody looked at her, she addressed the dead elf at the bottom of the grave. “Thank you so much, Dobby, for rescuing me from that cellar. It’s so unfair that you had to die, when you were so good and brave. I’ll always remember what you did for us. I hope you’re happy now.” She turned and looked expectantly at Ron, who cleared his throat and said in a thick voice, “Yeah . . . thanks, Dobby.” “Thanks,” muttered Dean. Harry swallowed. “Good-bye, Dobby,” he said. It was all he could manage, but Luna had said it all for him. Bill raised his wand, and the pile of earth beside the grave rose up into the air and fell neatly upon it, a small, reddish mound. “D’you mind if I stay here a moment?” he asked the others. They murmured words he did not catch; he felt gentle pats upon his back, and then they all traipsed back toward the cottage, leaving Harry alone beside the elf. He looked around: There were a number of large white stones, smoothed by the sea, marking the edge of the flower beds. He picked up one of the largest and laid it, pillowlike, over the place where Dobby’s head now rested. He then felt in his pocket for a wand. There were two in there. He had forgotten, lost track; he could not now remember whose wands these were; he seemed to remember wrenching them out of someone’s hand. He selected the shorter of the two, which felt friendlier in his hand, and pointed it at the rock. Slowly, under his murmured instruction, deep cuts appeared upon the rock’s surface. He knew that Hermione could have done it more neatly, and probably more quickly, but he wanted to mark the spot as he had wanted to dig the grave. When Harry stood up again, the stone read:* ***HERE LIES DOBBY, A FREE ELF.***  

Just the fact that he thought dobby deserved just as a grand funeral as dumbledore, really speaks to what i've been talking about this entire post, their friendship. That's what really matters, and that magic is really completely lost in the films. Even his last words don't feel earned at all in the films. In the books it's simple, it's just ''harry potter'', because that's all he needed to say, his actions spoke louder. Like him saving harry with the gillyweed, his present with the baubles he presented in the ROR, his crazy ass sweater he gave harry, warning him about umbridge, and even beating up kreacher because he talked shit about his boy, that's dobby, and all of that is lost in the films, and makes his death way less impactful. Both DH films always felt weird to me, in ways i couldn't really articulate, everything just felt, like less impactful and especially the death's. And i now i know why, it's not built up or set up. And that's the problem, you don't build off characters to just have them to die, you develop them first and then kill them, but it just felt the filmakers went the opposite way, and had the intent to kill him first, and didn't care about developing him because they just thought they were going to die in the end, so who cares. It's that level of carelessness that really shows in character's like dobby. And this happens all the time, just read this post again and replace dobby with sirius and it would pretty much be the same, or maybe even lupin too. But for now, it's dobby's turn for the spotlight. 

**In Conclusion**

I always feel like nobody really cared about dobby in the films tbh, like the only time he's actually mentioned is just like how it's better than neville gave him the gillyweed or whatever. But i feel like even in the films too, they really just didn't care about him. And it's not like he's some underrated nothing character, no he's prominent enough to get killed off spectacularly and plays major roles in the last few books. He doesn't get the respect he really deserves man, he honestly deserved so much better. And kreacher too man my god, how come he didn't show up in the end of the battle of hogwarts, such a missed opportunity. But then again, pretty much everything that has to do with dobby is a missed opportunity in the films. Also people who say kreacher had a better character arc than dobby? Like what was dobby's character arc? Huh? He loved harry through and through and really didn't change that much as a character. Whereas kreacher actually changed drastically and went from just hating harry's guts to serving faithfully and lovingly. Not really even related that much, but i just like it had to be said.",Dobby Really Deserved Better In The Films.,1673391091

harrypotter,"Don’t get me wrong all three were very good and solidified how I imagined the book versions of their characters going forward but which one fit their part most? 

I think it comes down to who your favorite character is. For me i thought Rupert Grint was the best cast. 

I thought he was the best of the three in the first couple of movies (“why can’t we follow the butterflies?” cracks me up) and starting with PoA it was about even. Ron was dealt dirty in the movies though and I attribute this to the scriptwriter. 

Harry i think is pretty close to the book version minus the sarcastic quips that were in the book.  We kind of got this in in Half Blood Prince with the Felix Felicis sequence but overall he’s more of a straight man, stereotypical hero character.

For Hermione I think the issue is that the movies made her feel more like Harry’s best friend than Ron did, which again I attribute to the scriptwriter. She also comes across to me as more bossy in the movies than in the books and I don’t know if it’s due to the script or Emma Watson’s direction.

harrypotter,"It's not exactly a secret that Warner Bros has seen better days. Amid a series of massive corporate reshufflings, and a string of unexpected box office flops, WB has made some HUGE decisions in the last year or so. 

While most of the attention has been put on DC, the Wizarding World franchise has also gone through some changes. Most namely, the cancellation of the Fantastic Beasts franchise. Secrets of Dumbledore is at least for now, the last Wizarding World movie, with the last two Fantastic Beasts movies no longer in production. 

However, this begs the question: What can WB do to make this a profitable film franchise again? Well, here is how I think they should go about it. 

**Albus Potter and the Cursed Child**

Now it's not exactly a secret that this project has been in consideration for some time now, however I think it would be the best direction to go. At least for right now. 

While the play was not very good at all (at least IMO), I think that a movie could fix some of the problems. 

I'd go with an entirely new villain, who isn't related to Voldemort or Bellatrix. Someone looking to maybe take the best aspects of Grindelwald and Voldemort and try to accomplish what they couldn't. Maybe, this new villain could be the same age as Albus and Scorpius, allowing for a new dynamic that we haven't seen before. A Wizarding World villain that's the same age as the main characters. 

I would most likely eliminate the time travel plotline, since I think that the time-turners should remain a rare item that's almost never seen. Maybe this idea could be explored in the future, but for a first movie, it's just not a good idea at all. 

Also, this is a no-brainer for me, but I'd bring back the original actors from the first 8 films to play their older selves. And yes, this does include Emma Watson, since it wouldn't make sense for Hermione to be a different race in this franchise. 

This could be the first in a new series of films, or it could be a one-and-done. But after the Fantastic Beasts franchise failed to appeal to casual audiences (and even hardcore fans), I think a big title like this would be the best way to bring attention back to this franchise. Just do what Disney did with Star Wars but do it better than they did. 

**The Marauders**

I'd make this the first TV show of the franchise, following a young James Potter, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew, and their various misadventures at Hogwarts. We could also see a lot of other younger versions of characters, such as Snape, Lily, Lucius, Bellatrix, Narcissa and Regulus. Not to mention all of the professors. 

This could be a much lower stakes show, simply focusing on relationship drama, teen angst and anxiety, and the meaning of friendship. However, we could also see the beginning of the Death Eaters and see a transition into the first Wizarding War against Voldemort. Ideally, I'd have the show end with Voldemort being defeated in Godric's Hollow, Lily and James being killed and Sirius being arrested. 

**The Founders**

This would either be a movie or a mini-series, and would follow the four founders of Hogwarts, and their early struggles with running the school. We'd see how they all first came together, how various aspects of the school were decided, and the eventual falling out between Salazar Slytherin and the rest of the founders. 

If this movie/series is a success, then I would leverage the popularity of it, to make a sequel based on the founding of Ilvermorny in America. I don't think it would be fair to completely ditch the American side of this world, just because of Fantastic Beasts' failure. Speaking of:

**Dumbledore and Grindelwald**

This trilogy would COMPLETELY retcon the Fantastic Beasts' trilogy out of existence and give us the version of this story that we should've gotten in the first place. We get to see Dumbledore's tough upbringing, his relationship/friendship with Grindelwald, and the eventual duel between them and Aberforth that would cost Aurelia her life. 

The second movie would be about Albus travelling the world and making a name for himself, eschewing the naive and bitter personality he would've had in the first film. Grindelwald would meanwhile be building his own band of supporters.

The third film would finally see the famous duel between the pair, ending with Dumbledore detaining his former love and sending him to Azkaban where Voldemort would later find him in Deathly Hallows Part 2.

* **Young Voldemort movie/show**
* Squib project (about finding purpose despite not being able to use magic)

harrypotter,"I, personally, feel that Snape and Lily knowing each other was random and just pulled out randomly. I think Rowling could have added a few small hints throughout the books for rereads as she did for the other books' plot twists. It just kind of surprised me when she did not build up to such a huge reveal.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, so now for where I think she could have added a hint. In OotP, Draco Malfoy insults Harry's mother causing Harry to be banned from quidditch by Umbridge. 

\&gt;“Or perhaps,” said Malfoy, leering as he backed away, “you can remember what your mother’s house stank like, Potter, and Weasley’s pigsty reminds you of it —”

I think it would have been cool if Snape was either on the field and reacted after Harry attacked Malfoy of course so the story could continue. Maybe Snape did not stop Malfoy from getting hurt like Harry expected and just stared with a sneer.  Or maybe instead of Snape being on the field,  McGonagall told Snape when Snape asked and Snape gave Malfoy detention. Of course, the book would not dwell on this and it would be one line like ""Snape gave Malfoy a week's detention for inciting a fight to Harry's surprise.""",Where do you think J.K. Rowling could have hinted at Lily and Snape's friendship?,1673381190
harrypotter," I like Mr. Weasley not trying to fight Lucius at Flourish and Blotts in the COS movie.

The book scene doesn't paint him in a bad light-he is defending his family and Hermoine after all.

However, the movie version fits his character much more: He sets a good example to the kids by defending his family with words, not violence.

Mark Williams is fantastic in this scene. When Lucius says, ""associating with Muggles"" he initially looks like he's about to strike Malfoy, but he quickly cools off, smiling at the kids as if assuring them 'The Malfoy's aren't worth it.'",Which scenes from movies do you prefer from the books?,1673380851
harrypotter,"So, when rereading the series I found the below text: 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;

They found an unpleasant-looking silver instrument, something like a many-legged pair of tweezers, which scuttled up Harry’s arm like a spider when he picked it up, and attempted to puncture his skin. Sirius seized it and smashed it with a heavy book entitled Nature’s Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy. There was a musical box that emitted a faintly sinister, tinkling tune when wound, and they all found themselves becoming curiously weak and sleepy, until Ginny had the sense to slam the lid shut; a heavy locket that none of them could open; a number of ancient seals; and, in a dusty box, an Order of Merlin, First Class, that had been awarded to Sirius’s grandfather for services to the Ministry.

&amp;#x200B;

Was the locket the horcrux of R.A.B. that was later stolen and sold to Umbridge?","Reading OoTP again, did they find a horcrux while cleaning Grimmauld's place?",1673379872
harrypotter,"I know a lot of people probably rank Malfoy's complicity in Dumbledore's death as the worst incident, but for some reason, I could never get over Malfoy's pretense that Buckbeak seriously injured him.  Malfoy was so happy that Buckbeak was going to be executed.  The boy was just plain evil.",Which incident makes you hate Malfoy the most?,1673379054
harrypotter,"I've seen the play in San Francisco and read the script. The story is fantastic. It had been 19 years since the Second War. In 19 years, muggles had invented computers that work as phones that fit in our pockets, self-driving cars, etc etc. In 19 years, it's entirely feasible that Time-Turners were reinvented and improved in the wizarding world. Draco is the inventor and despite his character arc in the harry potter stories, we never knew his academic achievements. I can see him being passionate about time travel because he has so many regrets from the past. Hermione is Minister for Magic, of course. Ron works with George at WWW fitting his character. Harry is an Auror, of course. Each of them has grown to become adults in those 19 years, becoming parents, and achieving/giving up on their dreams. They have matured and changed. Most of the opinions hating on the cursed child involve it being ""fan fiction"", the world not following the ""rules"" of the harry potter stories (19 years prior...), and that the characters have changed from their core beliefs (19 years prior...)

It is not ""fan fiction"", it's canon. The author of the story decided that this story was the one that she wanted to include in the canon of the story. It is written by a playwright rather than a young adult fantasy writer. So many of the qualms about the writing or story should simply be because you wanted something different to happen. If Rowling had been the original writer, you would say it was fantastic. The harry potter series is not flawless, there are numerous continuity issues within it regarding the ""rules"" of the wizarding world and the personality of the characters, and she completely caters to the audience she is writing for in the last book, but you do not call that ""fan-fiction"" because she was the writer. 

From 18 years old to 37 years old, most, if not all, people change, drastically. Wisdom is a real thing that occurs over time and each of these characters shows that the way they think is different from being a child. Harry's relationship with Albus is severely strained as many teenager/parent relationships are because the teenager is becoming their own person. 

Delphi being the daughter of Voldemort and Bellatrix is another point of contention. For some reason, people on this subreddit think that Voldemort is incapable or uninterested in sex because it was never mentioned in the harry potter series. Voldemort is a power-crazed dictator who would do anything to survive. He was a psychopath incapable of love or affection. But it is naive to think that sex is attached to love or affection. Sex is a biological function along with any cultural meaning that has been attached to it. Voldemort having sex with Bellatrix is entirely possible, and I would argue is accurate of his character. Bellatrix wanting to have the child of the person she was obsessed with is also a part of her character. It would increase her infamy playing into her ego as the only person to be close enough to the dark lord to have his child. Delphi grew up the same as Harry did. Both parents' true identities were hidden from her, growing up in a house with someone that did not like her, knowing parseltongue, and discovering who she truly was and the prophecy about her in her early teens.

harrypotter,"I don't mean as in killing him. He wouldn't know about the Horcuxes, but he would probably be able to kill his body, making Voldemort the sort of Ghost, that he was in the first couple of books. I asume he would win, due to multiple factors.

- Grindelwald relied on his skills alone, while Voldemort simply relied on his immortality. Voldemort was very skilled, but he mostly picked enemies much weaker than himself, and tried to avoid his one equally matched wizard (Dumbledore) at all cost. Also Grindelwald managed to subdue the Elder wand, even though he only stole it, while Voldemort didn't.

-Grindelwalds followers were actually loyal to him. They respected him. Only a few Death eaters followed Voldemort out of Loyalty. Most of them followed him, out of fear. That makes Grindelwalds followers much more willing to risk their lives for him, than Voldemorts followers.

-Grindelwald had a much bigger sphere of Influence. He controlled almost all of Europe, while Voldemort was just barrely able to hold Brittain, and failed to take down a school.",Grindelwald at his prime would have probably won against Voldemort at his prime,1673376201
harrypotter,[removed],does anyone know which movie i can find this scene?,1673375779
harrypotter,"I can't imagine this has never been posted before, but I haven't seen it if it has. But I just love the idea of a Harry and Dudley reunion down the road. 

After the final interaction with the Dursleys, I think we can all agree that Dudley partially redeemed himself. No, it doesn't alleviate all of the mistreatment of Harry over the years alongside Vernon and Petunia. But... He was still a kid when he was extra terrible to Harry and did seem to grow quite a bit after the dementor attack. I'm sure we all were terrible to some degree when we were young, but realizing this and changing for the better (hopefully) is part of growing up, and Dudley seemed to gain some perspective the following couple of years. 

So that brings me to the point of this post: after the amicable farewell between Harry and Dudley in DH, I like to think that the two reunited at some point in the future and even maybe became fond of each other, almost as if they were family... 

I saw a while back a fan fic post about the older crew showing up for Christmas at the Burrow from Mrs. Weasley's loving perspective. In that post, Kreacher was present, indicting a reunion with Harry after the Battle and a positive relationship forming out of an originally negative one. I'd love to see something similar with Harry and Dudley. I know he would probably never want to see Vernon and Petunia again, and vice versa, but I think that Harry and Dudley meeting up at some point and even having children that grew up knowing their cousins on that side of the family would be cool. Even if it was just something short like the above-mentioned fan fic. 

And if we really wanted to break that thang open, what if Dudley had a kid who wound up being a witch or wizard?? I mean... Dudley is related to the Potter side by blood via Lily, so it could definitely happen. I think a storyline where not only do we see the Harry/Dudley relationship develop, but we also see Dudley learning how to deal with being the parent of a wizard after the traumas and upbringing he experienced as a young boy. 

I'm not thinking a drawn out series or anything, just a fun little something something like the Christmas Burrow story. I don't know, maybe there isn't as much to it as I'm thinking, but I think there is some cool/fun potential there.",Dudley reunion?,1673375774

harrypotter,"Now, let me say this first- I too think the books are better. But I also think that this is the case with most adaptations. People have to remember- movies are far more limited in what they can show or do, and with those boundaries, I thought the movies were about as solid as they could've been. They had to be very particular about what they could include, and what they had to omit. Looking back, it's kind of a miracle how they weren't terrible with all the challenges they were facing. Most book to tv show adaptations don't even do as good a job of adapting the source material like the movies did (The Wheel of Time, for example)

Personally, the movies were incredibly successful in capturing the feeling of the books. I also like how the movies shift in tone similar to books as they go on. That might seem easy on the surface, but it's not.

I thought all the casting was perfect, (yes even Emma Watson) and the sets were in near-perfect congruency with the books.",Unpopular Opinion: People are too harsh on the movies,1673371416

harrypotter,"It comes as no surprise that there is a prejudice between the Wizarding World, and also Muggles. But can you believe that such prejudice could be created by Hogwarts itself? 

Today we're going to look at this topic with another tongue and cheek humor. Lets do this! 

First off we should know that the Wizarding World exist in secret due to the persecutions faced by them during the Middle Ages, and this was when Muggles were feeling that religious fever so to speak. But the interesting thing is as much as Hogwarts was founded to teach the wizarding arts. Salazar Slytherin the founder of House Slytherin wanted Hogwarts to be a school of pure born practitioners to be allowed to practice magic. He even took Godric Gryffindor's tathered hat to create, you guessed it.....The Sorting Hat to of course place prospective students into such houses.

So early on Sly Salazar schemed a tradition that is still used today, even it those intentions are to put it in a better term, ""good"". While later of course Daddy Salazar would leave Hogwarts with intentions of his own and disappear. He would leave behind The Chamber of Secrets for which had a Basalisk to be unleashed to kill off Muggle raised and Half Bloods to make way for those dastardly pure bloods like them annoying Malfoys. 

""But Ferrum you say, Hogwarts was a sanctuary for the Wizards and Witches, it's not that bad.""

While this might be true, even evil is a road paved with good intentions. Keep in mind that while Dumbledore did in fact eventually go on to become headmaster at Hogwarts. Before his time there, as revealed in the Fantastic Beast stories, and Deathly Hallows, him and Grindelwald shared a deep connection to look for those dark relics so they too could become masters of death. While Dumbledore might have wanted nothing but good intentions, his blind devotion to Grindelwald would have him follow such a dark path, making an unbreakable oath, and eventually cause him to duel Grindelwald for the fated Elder Wand. So while he sought to redeem himself, the hunger for power was always there.

Finally lets talk about the deeper secret, The Founding Houses, while competition is all in good fun and humor? Much animosity has always flourished between the Houses. Especially Gryffindor and Slytherin. Examples can be found between James Potter and Snape over Lily. Then you also have Harry and Draco, though in time they do put their differences aside to face Voldemort and the Death Eaters too. The point is rivalry runs deep, and while competition is big for the House Cup. Much of that rivalry still can carry over after the years at Hogwarts. 

So it begs for one to wonder, does Hogwarts and the Houses help influence the Wizarding World? Or consume it from within?

harrypotter,"In HBP after Harry's skull was cracked by McLaggen's bludger, he calls Kreacher to ask him to tail Malfoy. When Harry heard the signature crack of apparition, he saw two elves fighting. Kreacher, AND Dobby.

My question: How did Dobby know that Kreacher was apparating to Harry, and how the hell did he start fighting him mid-apparation? I thought that apparition was near instantaneous, and that no one could apparate next to you unless intentionally using side-along apparition.

Bonus question: In the same scene, Kreacher was insulting Harry, saying that he was friends with blood-traitors and whatnot. This, however contradicts Dobby.

harrypotter,"I basically came here to see if anyone else feels this way. As a kid I watched all the Harry Potter movies when they came out, starting from Prizoner of Azkaban (wasn't born before Chamber  of Secrets 💀),  and rematched them countless times at home with my family, especially my mum and my sister. 

I remember reenacting scenes with my sister when we were younger, and even reading the first 3 books as a kid too. Even though I didn't read all of the books, I can confidently say that Harry Potter has been a major part of my life and has always brought joy to me and my family.

Now that I'm older and me and my family have new lives and jobs obviously Harry Potter nights have become much less frequent. We still talk about them from time to time and still love the films but don't watch them nearly as much. 

Now on the rare occasion when I watch a movie, watch a clip of a scene on YouTube from one of the movies, or even listen to some of the scores, I get overwhelmed with emotion and nostalgia and start crying. I miss those moments of acting out scenes when I was younger and waiting for the new movies to come out, Harry Potter brought so much happiness to my life and still does to this day of course.

Second one - Dobby comes to warn Harry about the Chamber of Secrets plot and tell him not to go to Hogwarts. Because Harry refuses, Dobby levitates the cake which prompts the Ministry to send him a warning letter

Third one - Harry runs away from the Dursleys after blowing his aunt and runs into Sirius/Padfoot

Fourth one - Harry almost gets attacked by Ministry employees because someone used his wand to cast the Dark Mark. We later learn that this was Crouch Jr who is working to resurrect Voldemort

Fifth one - Dementors in Little Whinging prompt Harry to cast a Patronus which sets up the conflict between Harry and the Ministry throughout the book

Sixth one - This one is a little bit reversed. Dumbledore comes to pick up Harry to find Slughorn and tells him to have his wand out ready in case but tells him not to worry because he (Harry) is with him (Dumbledore) and then takes Harry on side-along apparition. At the end Dumbledore tells Harry that he is not worried because he is with him and Harry illegally (as he does not yet have an apparition license) takes Dumbledore back to Hogsmeade via side-along apparition

Seventh one - Harry performs a bunch of spells during the battle of the seven Potters despite being underage, but the biggest one is Harry's wand attacking Voldemort, which prompts Voldemort to go on his quest for the Elder Wand

harrypotter,"Also known as Darth Wannabe.

More to the point, I'm referring to a certain minor character from Jim Butcher's famous book series, The Dresden Files, introduced in the short story ""Day Off"" in the compilation book ""Side Jobs"" as the 'antagonist' of what's one of the funniest moment in the entire franchise. And I wanted to know what you think of both this particular story and the series as a whole, since the subject matter is more or less the same and there are many references to Harry Potter in it.

Why, exactly, am I posting this? To elaborate: That series deals with wizards, monsters and magic on a large scale, taking inspiration from all sorts of mythologies and folk stories and even urban legends in very creative ways while still finding a way to be accurate to the source material. And among the hordes of characters inspired by creatures of legend and mythical characters, we have a **very** minor magic talent who Harry Dresden, the main character, derides as a poser and threatens with a revolver.

Especifically, 'Darth Wannabe' is a young ""magic practitioner"" leading his own troupe of Ringwraith reject to get back at Dresden, the eponymous protagonist (Who actually got his name from Houdini, not Potter), 'cause he undid a ""curse"" he cast (Something so minor it was unmade with just some reiki). He tries to be impressive and dramatic, but Dresden calls him and his friends a bunch of tryhards who wears a lot of black, drive a van with goat skulls and inverted crosses painted on the sides and, of course, wear Slytherin scarves and have Dark Marks tattooed on their arms; he even tells them that while he liked the movies, you don't see them going *that* far.

Then, when they challenge to a duel, he tells the Dim Lord and his flying monkeys that if they want to see magic then he can show them some magic. Not by actually casting a spell ('Cause that'd be overkill against those kids), but making the windows on their van disappear with some good ol' gunshots.

Now that you got some context, tell me: If you know of this series, what do you think of it in general and/or compared to this series? I'm sure that you ought to at least have an opinion on stuff like wizardry being nigh completely self-taught, magic having no language for its spellcasting and the presence of characters like The Fair Folk, vampires that are more like their myths portrayed than what modern media says they are, full-blown gods and demons and even belief systems integrated into magic as a whole.

And if you don't, what do you think of this story? And no, the author wasn't actually taking cheap shots at Harry Potter or anything of the sort (And neither am I, for that matter). It's just that, since wizards are more integrated to modern-day civilization compared to wizarding society (Which says a lot, since Dresden wizards can and do live for hundreds of years if given the chance), there HAD to be practitioners of some sort who thought that being a Death Eater would be a good idea. lol",The Dim Lord,1673330685

harrypotter,"(When I say unrealistic, of course, I mean within the logic of this fantasy world)

I was 18 I think when I read The Order of The Phoenix for the first time and one thing I always found 'odd' was how easily they enter the Ministry of Magic without no one seeing them!

I mean, in the muggle world we have from more basic security systems to more complex and hard to crack ones. 
Cameras, security guards, locks, alarms, etc. And for a public building like that, I expected good security.

Of course, they wouldn't be ""cameras"" there,  but not guard? no magic detectors or alarms? maybe I was expecting some equivalent to our security system somehow. 

Am I the only one who thought this was kinda odd?

harrypotter,"Quick note: this O.C. would be around at least 50-100 years after the events of Harry Potter. 

So I know most of the time, (it feels like) when people make an original character it's a student. but I had an idea for a teacher. This Teacher would teach Care of Magical Creatures and is a Half-Giant and Werewolf. But unlike every other Werewolf he is the first one who can fully control himself. Meaning if for some reason they needed to do a class at night during a full moon. He would be able to 100% no issue. (Just might get a tail wag when you answer correctly)

**Looks:** But Let's see if I can describe him well enough for you to picture them. I want to say he is about 9 feet in height, and very very muscular. I guess think of something between Hulk and Professor Hulk. Black hair in the style of a mohawk, reminiscent to a viking style. And of course he's just hairy all over thanks to the werewolf in him. Has lots of faded tattoos that look like they could be 1, very very detailed and it's just hard to tell now. OR they were just always a mess. A beard in between Hagrids and Dumbledore but tied into one braid. He has one Blue eye and one fully white eye with a nice scar going from the top of that eyebrow to his upper lip, (with a few other scars over his body) and his K9 teeth are always a bit bigger, even when not a werewolf. 

**Clothing**: For clothing he would wear just a harness on around his torso during the hot months were he would have bags attached to keep everything he needs. During the winter months he wears a normal shirt with the sleeves (most of the time) ripped off. 1-3 belts at all time depending on what he needs with him. For bottoms you can see him in some just normal pants, sometimes a fur-like kilt or one year a student got him a pair of super nice Jeans which he only wears if he is going to Hogsmead or on the weekends.

**Personality**: For being so ""rugged"" He takes great care of himself. making sure he never smells (students and teachers say he smells like firewood, a tiny bit of musk with a hint of vanilla. His Voice is deep and with a guttural growl to it. to the point he can scare people if he is not careful. He also knows signed language and teaches it to students who want to learn. to put his personality in a very blunt text. ""Looks like they can kill you, is a cinnamon roll. It's hard to get him upset but you can tell when that happens because he starts to stutter.

**Magical / Abilities:** Despite being a werewolf/half-gaint he is well versed in magic. Seemingly because of all the negative stereotypes put on him, He worked that much harder to overcome them and show people what he is capable of. He is even able to do wandless and wordless magic (though of course not nearly as strong) and can even block a few spells with himself alone. (Remember they needed to hit Hagrid with 4 stun spells before it did anything to him.) While in his werewolf form he is of course much stronger and faster but can't use magic. 

**Weaknesses:** While he works very hard to make sure he comes off nice and approachable some days it can be harder then others. Due to his size and voice he can be scary. to the point normally 1st years avoid him at all costs until a older student or teacher comes in and changes that. As stated before when he gets upset he starts to stutter, and goes until he looses his temper (which is extremely rare) and when that happens he turns into a crying mess. Also While is able to control himself, he knows at one point his werewolf instincts might be to much and that scares him. He is also known to be a bit to confident. Once having to be talked out of being hit with a killing curse because as he put it ""My pecs are so big it would bounce right off"" But that only happens after a few hours of drinking.

**Fun Facts**  
1. He ""owns"" 3 wands. His own and his Mothers, and his grandfathers.  
2. All Wands are inside one wand that is more like a staff to normal people. He rarely uses it however. More or less using ""wandless magic""  
3. His own ""personal"" wand was a 20 inch blackthorn with a dragon heartstring core.  
4. He was in  Gryffindor, but almost was put in Hufflepuff. The shorting hat took a bit trying to choose  
5. He was in the top 10 of his class  
6. Tried to play quidditch but brooms really cant hold that much weight  
7.  Hagrid is a hero to him  
8. He loves to apperate  
9. He wants to try and master fiendfyre but is to nervous to do so.  
10. Before coming teacher he was an Auror.  
11. One time while eating breakfast a bad wizard hit him with a curico curse. He finished his breakfast then calmly walked over to the gun before punching him out cold. Thats one of his more favorite rumors.  
12. During the summer months he takes a bath in the lake. Just be careful going out around midnight.  
13. He lives pretty much in the same spot where Hagrid lived. However his hut is bigger and has more of a ""castle light house"" feel to it.  
14. He is pansexual and has been known to be the ""handsome teacher"" by students and teachers. However if you say anything he turns beat red.  
15. He tries to help in the kitchen, but due to his size really can't and mostly annoys the house elves.  
17.  He swears... a lot  
18. He has a sister (fully human wizard) who works in the M.O.M. Her son goes to Hogwarts.  
19. In between Hogwarts and being an Auror he worked in a more ""adult"" field  
20. He is a candidates to one day become headmaster   
21. He LOVES LOVES LOVES to sing. However he sounds worse then mermaids out of the water.

harrypotter,"Hermione most likely felt insecure about herself in her own way, although not showing it. She most likely felt she was not attractive enough, not funny enough and simply not Ron's tempo. This might be one reason why she was so mad at Fleur all the time. She scowled when she kissed Ron, and was thoroughly foul to Fleur when she stayed at the Burrow. Because Fleur was a born beauty to male eyes from her genes alone. Having been mocked look-wise before, she probably felt that Ron would never choose her. And the fact that she was inherently nerdy while Ron obviously seemed to prefer hanging with more laid-back, outwardly funny and joking styled kids more (not that he didn't like Hermione being around him) probably didn't help.

As for Ron, it's obvious why he was insecure. Krum and Potter. Both of them famous throughout countries. One for being an amazing Quidditch player. One for hoodwinking the dark lord almost every year since he attended Hogwarts, and beating him as a boy. Both were extremely popular and liked by girls (Harry was only really liked after he did something cool, like prove he was right which in the eyes of girls, made him some masculine tough god who was strong and resilient). And, as Hermione's other best friend, both were on equal terms with Hermione, so he wouldn't really have a head start on her if it became a race to see who could charm her.

So in the end, both were just so blinded by the negative mindset of ""oh, they're gonna want someone else"" that they couldn't realize that the ""competition"" they had wasn't even real. Krum was more of a friend/experimental relationship than a long-term partner. Harry showed no signs of romantic affection for Hermione and likewise. And Fleur was more of eye-candy to Ron than someone he'd actually date in the future. Both actually liked each other, but couldn't even see it.",I thoroughly enjoyed how Ron and Hermione always liked each other but were too insecure and jealous to see it,1673324332

harrypotter,"Currently rereading the books after having only read them when I was very young, and something has become glaringly obvious; Harry Potter is a stupid child who is too proud for his own good. 

It’s obvious that it’s because he is young and stupid, thinking he always knows right because that’s what teenagers do. But because the movies follow an actor who ages 2-3 years between each movie that only has a 1 year gap, it feels like Harry is more mature in the 4th movie onwards. Radcliffe also acts older in his delivery and I can’t help but feel like they probably wrote the movies that way to make him sound more his own age. 

It’s not until you read the book when you realize that Harry Potter is painfully young. So young that I’ve been yelling in my head about things that happen in the 4th and 5th books simply because if he just wasn’t such a proud little brat, things would be so much easier for everyone. He could tell the truth, speak, and ask questions, but having watched the movies for so long, I’ve forgotten how young he is and how undeveloped that makes his brain. Hermione acts like the only sane person in a group of idiots, being the only voice of reason for a grown up reader which is a nice way to grasp some sense of sanity when I’m reading a young teen make bafflingly accurate decisions for someone his age.","It’s very easy to forget how young Harry is supposed to be in the movies, but NOT in the books",1673318875

harrypotter,"As many of you know, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child recently made its return to major theatre areas around the world. This new version of the play was only one part as opposed to two, cut around 1.5 hours worth of story, and features a new love story. I never saw the original version of the play, but I did read the script... and like a lot of people, I truly hated most of what I read. The characterizations of everyone were terrible, the constant usage of nostalgia felt off-putting, and the idea that Cedric Diggory was an important-enough character to warrant the entire ""eighth story"" in the HP being about him was just so weird. I didn't have any plans to see this on the stage and thought that was the end.

But this month, a family member of mine, who's a big fan of Harry Potter, got tickets to see this new version of the story. I was invited to watch it as well, so I attended the show in Toronto. I said to myself, even though I didn't like the script, I wanted to keep an open mind about what I was about to watch. Even with my problems with the story, I was intrigued by how the crew would pull off the production/magic stuff. 

I sat in my seat, the lights went down, and for 3 hours and 20 minutes, I was... incredibly disappointed. This story just does not work. In every sense of it, this story falters completely. The pacing is terrible, the dialogue is atrocious, Harry Potter is an absolutely terrible father despite nothing in the previous stories pointing to this becoming a possibility, most female characters are shafted completely then reappear randomly (Ginny, Rose, and even Hermoine), Ron gets nothing to do, Delphi is without-a-doubt the worst villain in the franchise, and the usage of Voldemort, Snape, and Cedric had my rolling my eyes. Somehow, the show felt jarringly fast and incredibly slow at the same time. In order to save time from the previous version, the first 20 minutes feel like an F1 race on steroids before coming to a screeching halt to actually set up the story, which again, is so boring and pretty confusing to keep up with. 

The saving grace of this new version is Albus and Scorpius' love story, which is a new addition. Despite not getting nearly enough time to actually explore their relationship, they were just adorable together, but nothing more. Honestly, if you do without all the bigger Harry Potter stuff, this story between the two young men would be a fairly standard, and enjoyable rom-com. But no, we have to get a story about Harry constantly going after Albus and Albus acting like the worst teenager to ever exist. 

I don't know if it's Jack Thorne, Rowling, or whoever else was involved in the writing of both versions of this story, but it's just awful. This should've probably been a movie to begin with, as then they could at least pull this thing off visually, but even then, after reading the script, I'd say kill it with fire. 

The actual production of the play was solid, with the crew using pretty cool optical illusions and practical effects to pull off the magic of the universe. But after a while, you'll find yourself wondering about how something would've and could've looked better if this was just a movie or TV show. There are just certain things in the HP universe that don't work on stage... mainly, WIZARD SPELLS. 

I'm all for supporting stage productions, but this one is just bad. I guess it's a saving grace that I saw the 3-hour version instead of the 5... because if I almost fell asleep during the Toronto production, who knows what would've happened in the London production. 

And just one more thing... none of this has anything to do with the cast. If any of you come across this post, know that none of you are the problem with this show and you all did a fine job. The writing is not nearly up to par with your acting skills.",I recently watched the revised version of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child and I have a lot of thoughts...,1673309785

Now as many people have said a tv series would be the perfect way to go about it and be able to be more faithful to the books. My biggest worry however is will the people who work on a potential series be passionate about making a faithful adaptation of these stories because I could totally see them wanting to put their own stamp on the series and make a lot of unnecessary changes to make it completely different from the books and movies.

You can name a hundred bad adaptation, but the one as unanimously loved by their fandom as hp are few and far between. One, if not several, of all those things that went right the first time is bound to go wrong this time (my bet is on Rowling view on her work and her importance in it having greatly changed since the release of the first movie).

harrypotter,"Magical evolution theory suggests that given what we know about the magical world, it is likely if not inevitable that the magical world will engulf the muggle world. The main points I will use to prove this will be population, politics and human nature because at the end of the day wizards are human too.


To start with we know that the population of witches and wizards is low during the events of the books. After dealing with the magical wars, two by voldemort and one grindlewald, there is likely to be a baby boom just like with our world after world war 2. Because of the acceptance of muggle born witch and wizards into wizarding society the population will soon ovwrtake muggles. We don't know the rates at which these people are born but given how many appear in the books I think it is fair to say the numbers are significant and only going to rise. 

An argument against this is the birth of squibs or non magical people born to magical family's. However I would argue that there is clear evidence that these people are likely to stay in the wizarding world. Filch is evidence that squibs are not kicked out of society, given how prejudiced the wizarding community is shown to be I'm sure that most squibs are treated as second class citizens, but I would say they are still more likely to stay in the wizarding world this I'd because they are not likely to leave to the almost alien muggle world. Arthur Weasley who is meant to work in the field of muggles is fascinated by simply things like the underground escalator and a rubber duck. The average wizard is going to be terrified at the idea of joining the muggle world. I would also say that life for squibs in the wizarding world is likely to get better again proved by Flitch working at one of the most prestigious wizarding school in the world. We are also shown that the younger generations are much more progressive when it comes to non magical people showing again that life will improve as the years pass. Plus there is the improvement to life that comes with living inside a magical world even without magic, bewitched items to make life easier would surely make even people without magic want to stay. 

Another point against my theory is that the magical world is just more dangerous, so the numbers of population will not grow. Jobs like inventing magic potions and caring for dangerous magical creatures and plants. But to this I would say these jobs are more likely to be few and far between rather than the norm. The magical world must have stores, restaurants and business of all kinds. Just like in the muggle world most jobs are likely to be safe. Even with the dangous jobs it is clear that health care in the wizarding world is much better than the muggle with people living much longer and being healed from most injuries and illnesses. 

Now if you accept my point that the population will rise through the decades then I believe this would bring in many changes for the wizarding world namely lack of jobs. With magic the jobsof ten people can be done with one spell and with better health care and easy work, just casing spells the age and amount of people retiring is like to go down substantially. This will make more witches and wizards poorer and dangling on the poverty line. Also as the population grows space will come at a premium. We have seen that magic can do strange things with space (tent at quidditch world cup) but even with this there is only so much space and so much money to buy the available space to go around. This will push poor and poorer witches and wizards closer and closer to the muggle world with poor people almost rubbing shoulders with muggles. 

I  belive this will all come to a head with poor witch's and wizards being becoming poorer and angrier and angrier. I belive it wouldn't take much, a charismatic smooth talking dark witch or wizard, to use this unrest. They could to work their way up the political system to be voted minister of magic. They could then use this position with the backing of the people to start a war with the muggle world for space and control of the planet. This dark Lord would be different than any that came before as unlike Voldemort this person would have the backing of a country and more legitimacy. 

I know what your thinking, earlier I argued that the wizarding world is getting more progressive now I'm say there is going to be a war with them. The difference is I didn't say which ministry was going to war. It is clear that there are a great many. There is the British one in the main books then there is an American ministry, who is to say there is not a great many ministries just like in the muggle world, all with different ideas and ideals of how the world should work just like in this world. But it just takes one of them to be corrupted by a dark wizard or by bad politics for a war to start. 

In closing I belive this is inevitable as the population grows and poor people are squeezed more and more, hiding will seem almost pointless, the liklihood goes up and up as population rises. We know there are many dark wizards who could easily use this tension to rise up and exercise power, the angrier the people are the easier it will be to turn the anger on to an ""other"" in this case muggles. But there will still be progressive wizards and a progressive ministry who will fight to save muggles but this will most likely, with the massive number of wizards, lead to the unveiling of the wizarding world. The outcome of the war in my mind is irrelevant, as soon as it starts the wizarding world is over and it is just the world with whole new challenges of co habition.

I belive the only thing that could stop this outcome are more magical wars, if the wizarding world can't come together and get along long enough for their numbers to grow they can't outnumber muggles. If the magical community doesn't progress as is expected and doesn't become more welcoming to non magical people like squibs and muggleborns and pushes them out of the magical world and into the muggle one then the overpopulation won't happen as quickly or at all.

harrypotter,"Hot off the latest Xmas rewatch, I've been on a Potter bender.

One thing that stood out to me in this rewatch was Harry's emotional evolution and how expertly it's handled. I particularly love Harry's choices in Prisoner of Azkaban. See, a complaint about Harry Potter is that if he would just tell the adults AKA Dumbledore what's going on, a lot of problems would be solved. However, Book 3 really presents a plausible reason for Harry to not be able to share what he knows with Dumbledore, as Sirius is at first a personal vendetta Harry feels some shame for, and later as a fugitive, Harry can't fully expose Sirius.

Then, by the time Harry realizes he really just needs to tell Dumbledore what's up, the headmaster becomes a fugitive. Then, he dies.

So this question of ""Just tell the adults what you know"" becomes complicated very very quickly.

Now let's consider why Harry is the ""Boy who lived"". As he says, even up until Order of the Phoenix, his phenomenal 3/3 record against Voldemort is due to luck, help and unknown factors. He of all people, worthy because of confronting fear and danger courageously, nevertheless admits that his success is not in any way a product of his own skill or power.

Harry lived because of Lily's old magic spell. That was broken by Voldemort's deep spell. Azkaban, the only book where Harry did not confront Voldemort, features a telling prophecy, and the events surrounding Pettigrew. I suspect there is a link between the prophecy and the intention of Voldemort. In the magical world, powerful wizards shape events which become spells. These are mirrored by prophecies which become more true as the spells grow in power. Understand?

In the book ""Johnathan Strange and Mr. Norrell"" there are two gentlemen of England, who many years after the disappearance of magic, are somehow able to do it again. In the end, a strange and seemingly minor encounter with a malicious fey folk becomes a massive set of spells that changes England. It turns out this seemingly random, malicious fey might have been connected to the great master of English magic since Merlin, the Raven King. The random events circumscribing the lives of Johnathan Strange and Mr. Norrell turn out to be products of a weird and wonderfully planned spell by the Raven King to trick and defeat this powerful and evil fairy. The fairy is totally tricked, almost up to the level in which Eru Iluvatar tricks and defeats Sauron by using the curse of his own magic to - through Gollum by way of the kindness of Frodo - curse the Ring to meet its own demise.

I am completely certain, through Deathly Hallows, that Dumbledore used the Deathly Hallows - a very vague, mysterious, and tangentially but mysteriously powerful magic - to complete a spell he had been casting for many years. Harry Potter was merely a lucky ingredient of the spell to defeat Voldemort. Yes, Voldemort was defeated because of a masterful, god-tier advanced spell of Dumbledore in which Harry was a mere ingredient.

Thus, in this interpretation of advanced magic where manipulating people and events and incorporating varieties of magic produces strong and unimpeachable results, Slytherin House was made part of Hogwarts.

We easily forget the emblem of Ravenclaw isn't - lol - a raven. It's an Eagle. This is an imperial emblem. The lion is regal. The badger is defiant. The snake is something else.

Hogwarts is not merely a school. It is a spell cast upon English magic. It is as profound as the spell of the Raven King. It affects all English magic, and resonates through the wider world due to England's connection to old magic.

It's not that Slytherin is tolerated. Slytherin is part of the spell. The Basilisk was the spell's concession to Salazar. Yes, of course Slytherin is evil. But Hogwarts is a spell meant to drive a line between the muggle and magical worlds. To protect BOTH of them, and allow wizards to deal with the arcane and dangerous elements of the magical universe (goblins, beasts, elves, etc.)

Thus we must not think of Slytherin as evil. Instead. We must become part of the spell, the legacy of Merlin. We must be grateful that magic and muggle are regulated and put in order, for the benefit of both.

The topic of what muggles might do to the magical world is fascinating. It invokes the concept of ""before"" old magic. Of a magic that muggles can invoke, the grand and greater spells. Magic can't make food or gold. The mundane and profane can. Science is like a sweeping uber-magic. It's universal common sense. Plato's forms, shared by all to no one's benefit unless they are universally obeyed. Where the wizard can refuse to obey, the muggle must. But, the muggle, in obeying, might gain a greater power.

In other words, don't be so hard on Slytherin. Hogwarts is a wizard's spell and a grand one.",Is Slytherin Evil? Why Does It Exist. A Hot Merlin Take to Justify It All.,1673237597

I have never been a fan of David Yates. He ruined OotP for me by cutting out a lot of the scenes that really showcased Harry's growth as a character. I've always thought that the odd-numbered installments in HP (with the exception of Deathly Hallows) were more about character development and how everything was affecting him, while the even-numbered installments were more story-driven. Yet Yates cut most of those scenes out, and pulled a lot of punches (i.e. muting Harry's scream when Sirius falls through the veil and not having him lash out at Dumbledore the way he did in the book). And where the hell was the scene where it was revealed that Umbridge (who was nowhere near as sadistic as she was in the book) ordered the dementor attack on Harry? The only thing I was impressed by was his adapting the longest book in the series into the shortest film, but I think they could have made an alternate cut of the film with some of the scenes that were left on the cutting room floor being added and some of the existing scenes being cut which would be roughly the same length.

He got better with the subsequent films (possibly due to Steve Kloves returning as screenwriter) but they still weren't as good IMO as the first four films. I know that politics play a significant part in the story, but the tone of Yates's later films is a little too political IMO. Combining the politics with the way in which most of the characters are dressed in the later films hardly makes it seem like a fantasy film about wizards at all.

I don't agree with the stuff that JKR has said in recent years, but I think she's a good writer, and I think Steve Kloves is a good screenwriter. But David Yates is not a good director for the Wizarding World franchise because he doesn't know which scenes are essential to the story and which ones can be cut or re-worked. Also, Yates went from directing low-budget, made-for-TV movies to one of the largest franchises of all time without any stepping stones in between. Chris Columbus had ""Home Alone"", Alfonso had ""A Little Princess"", Mike Newell had ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" as well as an extensive resume dating back to the 1960s (I don't think his ""Bollywood"" direction style would have worked for most of the films but it worked for GoF), and Yates? The previous film he directed before OotP was ""The Girl in the Cafe"", and all of his films were either TV movies or shorts. Outside of the UK he was practically unknown. So he was an odd choice of director IMO.

I still think they have a shot at steering the FB franchise in the right direction but they need to get the right person for the job.","What if the reason why the FB series failed isn't because of JKR and the writers, but because of David Yates?",1673215994

harrypotter,"I decided to read through the HP books for the first time in many years, taking notes about various things as I did so to keep track of everything.

One of those things is the locations of various places within Hogwarts and, more specifically to this post, the entrance to the Gryffindor common room. I'd gotten the majority of the way through the first book believing that the entrance to the Gryffindor Tower was through a hole behind the portrait of the Fat Lady at the end of a corridor on the second floor.

My reason for thinking it's on the second floor is from a few pieces of evidence:

* When Percy first leads them to the common room from the Sorting Ceremony's feast, they climb multiple staircases - that puts it on a floor higher than floor 1 (i.e. at least floor 2).
* When going back to the common room after defeating the troll in the girls' toilet (which I believe is on the ground floor), Ron and Harry don't talk until they've climbed two floors up. Then a brief conversation is described and they reach the common room. From this quote, it's possible for the entrance to be more than two floors up, but I think it's implied to be on the second floor, and it's definitely not lower than the second floor.
* When going to the trophy room to duel Malfoy, they went up a staircase to the third floor. Now, even if there were more than just this one staircase (which isn't implied), this means that it's definitely below floor 3.

If it's at least as high as the second floor and lower than the third floor, it must be on the second floor - there's no other option.

Nothing contradicted this throughout the book, so I held fast to my belief. Until they sneak out at night to the forbidden third-floor corridor to stop ""Snape"" from stealing the Philosopher's stone. In this instance, they go up two sets of stairs - the first of which Mrs Norris is skulking at the top of and they climb around her, the second of which, which is mentioned as ""the staircase up to the third floor"", Peeves is floating halfway up.

I was a bit confused by the contradiction to what I thought was the truth, so I googled for the location of the Gryffindor common room. Imagine my surprise when all the sites say it's on the seventh floor! 

I looked at what the source for that is, and the wiki says ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game)."" Are the video games really the accepted source of canon over the books? Or is this backed up elsewhere in later books?

I'm going to note down the contradiction I found as a potential plot hole or potential for a strange Hogwarts layout (e.g. the first corridor led to a balcony halfway up the second floor and the second corridor led the rest of the way up to the third floor) and keep making notes as I read to try and figure it out. But the thing with the seventh floor is just crazy imo, since there are at least two quotes showing them going upwards from the common room to the third floor.

harrypotter,"I’ve been rewatching the Harry Potter films recently and beside the fact I think there are a lot of issues with how jk wrote and told the story of character’s one who I always will think is unfairly hard done by and wasted is Draco.

Jk Rowling should of written a book showing the life of Draco and his mother, by how their relationship and the lestrange family seem I’d think that Narcissus marriage to Lucius was arranged and abusive and that part of Dracos horrible attitude came from his home life and how his father was horrible to him and his mother. 
Rowling should of written a book showing a pov of Dracos home life and maybe even including how his mother and father met. Rowling then should of showed different areas of Draco’s life leading up to half blood Prince which then goes into Dracos battle with wanting to be good but being in a situation where he’s forced to be bad.

A book like this could of been really interesting and given Dracos character the depth it really needed.
However all in all I hate Dracos ending anyway I think a much better ending would be if at the end of half blood Prince he chose not to kill Dumbledoor by his own choice not Snape stopping him and then joined the order leading him to help out in deathly hallows and maybe once again in his own book showing the effects of him being a Slytherin who turned good!",Jk Rowling should of made a separate Draco Malfoy book showing his pov.,1673215274

2] Why haven't wizards taken over the world? In the books, magic seemed, if not quite trivial, then at least relatively on-par with the power of one-man technology. This is to say that a single wizard couldn't utter a few words and set off the equivalent of a nuclear bomb. Even when Voldemort and Co. blew up a bridge, that appeared to be a) an extremely impressive feat, and b) a group effort by the Death Eaters.

In Magical Beasts, not only are single wizards essentially wordlessly shattering buildings, but it's pretty clear that average American Aurors are just amble to effortlessly reassemble said destruction in seconds. 

Moreover, we know from the books that even a lot of wizards who AREN'T Death Eaters consider themselves to be superior to the rest of humanity. So you have this subset of elitist super-beings, many of whom think they've transcended humanity, and... Grindlewald and Voldemort are just wildly ""out there"" in aiming for some form of world conquest/subjugation? Wha??",Saw Fantastic Beasts for the first time last night...,1673198915

harrypotter,"Hottake: The way most people understand the house system is wrong. The way most people seem to think it works is like star signs, where you get a full batch of personality traits that you need to adhere to, most of them being subject to fairly substantial change in a normal human ages 11 to 17. 
 Due to this, a lot of people decry the house system as impractical, and bad, something that I am inclined to agree with 
HOWEVER, I don’t think that this is how it was intended, at least not by the founders of Hogwarts. 
 In the legend of the Secret Chamber, McGonnagal tells us about the founding of Hogwarts. She says that the founders couldn’t agree on which students to teach, so they all taught their own houses. Slytherin wanted to teach purebloods, so to get into Slytherin you needed to be a pureblood. To get into Ravenclaw you needed to hold knowledge as the highest virtue, to get into Gryffindor you needed to be exceptionally brave, and Hufflepuff took the rest. 
 This interpretation is way more practical from the viewpoint of the founders, as it solves their original problem.
The different personality traits that are assigned to the houses, I think are prejudices that evolved later: Samrt people are awkward eggheads, Brave people reckless jocks, etc. Being a stereotype for your house was never an intended requirement to get in. 
 Now I realise, that the legend is the only confirmation we have of this interpretation, but I at least think that this is the version that makes the most sense.","The house system has been completely misunderstood, and retconned!",1673188675

My original thought was that George betted against Hermione, whereas Fred against Ron. In the books it is clear that George can be seen as somewhat more of the empathic brother, I feel like he might as well have more faith in Ron then Fred would have, who was rumored to end up with Hermione before the original ending of the series.

Maybe it's the Ravenclaw in me, but I would absolutely love to do some data analysis to look for correlations and relationships between people's houses, wand types, patronuses, and other information.

If you'd like to participate, please comment your wizarding world information (house, wand, and patronus), as well as any other information you'd like to (but you dont have to) include, like your gender identity, Myers-Briggs type, where you're from (state or country), etc.

For example, here's mine:
- House: Ravenclaw
- Wand: Hawthorn, Phoenix Feather, 11 3/4 inches, unyielding
- Patronus: Siberian Cat
- Gender Identity: Female
- Myers-Briggs Type: ISFJ
- Where I'm From: Wisconsin, USA

The only thing I ask is that you only comment your official wizarding world results, not which house/wand/patronus you'd like to have. And please don't comment your results if you knowingly answered dishonestly to get the result you wanted, just because I want to keep the data as accurate as possible.

I'll need quite a few people to comment in order to get a large enough sample size, so even if you dont want to participate, if you could at least upvote this thread so more people will see it, I'd appreciate it.

Thank you!!

harrypotter,"Specifically, about the prophecy. I would've written about it in my previous thread about it (see here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/sxz2pn/in\_harry\_potter\_do\_the\_prophecies\_all\_come\_true/](https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/sxz2pn/in_harry_potter_do_the_prophecies_all_come_true/)) but it was locked, so I'm making a new one. 

The prophecy was to be fulfilled, of that I'm almost certain for two reasons: 

1) Dumbledore lied to him about the fact that he must die in order to destroy the last horcrux inside of him, something it was certainly needed to fulfill the prophecy. Dumbledore in ""Half-Blood prince"" tries to convince Harry of the importance of acting of his own free will, but this must be surely because, being a very smart man, he knew Harry would've acted against it at the last moment, and reassuring him he must choose himself ensures him the prophecy, not the headmaster, will correct Harry's path. Don't forget that Dumbledore's plan was for Harry to fight Voldemort AFTER destroying all the horcruxes, while we all know the snake was still alive at the time. 

2) For me, at the last duel of Harry v Voldemort, the clue that the prophecy was in action was the fact the Elder Wand belonged to Harry. In the hands of Voldemort, it wouldn't have worked. Especially because Harry didn't intend to kill Voldemort. Instead, the Avada Kedavra made by Voldemort rebounded, but it all acted automatically, after the prophecy set things in motion. Chance wasn't there at that duel.

He fought Dumbledore and judging from the film, Dumbledore didn’t have problems facing someone holding the wand.  Dumbledore fought Voldemort using the wand at the ministry and impression’s are, what the difference with a wand that everyone’s using?

And definitely wasn't worth all the harm he had caused. Even at the end when voldemort tells him that he's gotta die he does nothing to resist it.

harrypotter,"Growing up, I loved the Harry Potter series. I credit the series getting me interested in reading and the fantasy genre in general. It also inspired the loner child I was to make friends because I envied the friendship that the main characters had. 

As an adult I still loved the series in the same way that I love How the Grinch Stole Christmas - fondly with warm memories of bonding with friends and siblings over it and occasional rereads and rewatches. 

However now, post all the drama with Rowling, it’s just lost its place entirely in my life. I’ve not reread or rewatched any of the books or movies in years and any time I think of it or come across the series, I just feel deep disappointment. Today I attempted to engage by venturing into this sub after being away for a long time and I have finally conceded that it’s over for me.

harrypotter,"Obviously Snape would no sooner tell Harry hints to help him to his face, than award Gryffindor 10 points for a job well done in class, but considering he and Dumbledore were in on the ""protect Harry at all costs"" plot, you'd think one of them would step up to the job. As for Dumbledore, this is even dumber. Yeah, I know there's a magical contract (and it makes NO sense how a magical object that's meant to choose 17+ year olds for a inter-school contest would create a magical contract that's above Dumbledore's magical powers to destroy/change it), but the contract never stopped Harry from cheating, or anyone else from cheating, at that. And obviously, playing fair in a competition that's reward is fame and 1000 galleons to the winner, is nothing compared to the grand plan of stopping the greatest Dark Wizard who seeks to put the world under his foot.

So why, may I ask, did Dumbledore not take every measure necessary to ensure Harry's safety. The kid could've died several times over (he almost got slammed by a Horntail's tail in the movie and got slashed in the arm in the books). If I was Dumbledore, I'd be taking no risks and be secretly giving him info from the sidelines. Heck, I'd even manipulate the competition while it unfolds to ensure his safety (come on, he's the greatest Wizard to live, there's no way that he'd be unable to hoodwink some Ministry officials and a bunch of teenagers to help Harry cheat). As for Snape, you'd think he'd convey some handy tips to someone else who'd convey it then, to Harry. He's been anonymously watching Harry from the sidelines and it's stupid how he'd be willing to take such a gamble on Lily's sake on something so dangerous. Crazy how a Death Eater who wanted Harry dead ended up ensuring Harry's safety in the tournament more than people who had to keep him alive to destroy the Dark Lord.",Why didn't Dumbledore and Snape help Harry cheat,1673062975

harrypotter,"The series ends with the words “All was well”. But how can it be that all was well if nothing essentially changed after the defeat of Voldemort? 

The wizarding world is extremely racist towards every other sentient magical race (goblins, elves, merpeople, centaurs, giants, etc). Such a world allowed the Ministry of Magic to be formed, which constantly abuses its power and benefits from said racism (mainly via goblins and elves), while preventing all other races from using wands and thus maintaining their hegemony. It is out of that system that somebody like Voldemort rose to power and if you think about it nothing essentially changed after he was defeated. There were no systemic changes in their world that could prevent something like that happening again. And Voldemort really isn’t that much worse from the majority of other wizards, he is just more extreme and his racism extends to muggles and muggle-borns as well. 

After Rowling introduced elements to the world such as slavery or the goblin rebellions (in which the goblins had a violent uprising protesting against their mistreatment by wizards), defeating Voldemort simply isn’t a satisfying enough ending. 

Yet, none of the characters seem to care that the world is so broken. You would expect Harry to be a bit more empathetic considering he grew up in the muggle world and should thus not be desensitized but shocked at the inequality of this new world, yet he doesn’t care at all. When he finds out that Slughorn has been testing poisons on house elves his first thought it how annoyed Hermione would be. And the entire resolution to the slavery plot line is that elves enjoy being slaves. What the hell?

Rowling seems to think that just because Harry and Hermione now work for the ministry that everything is fine, when that would be impossible because the same broken systems still exist.",Why doesn’t a single character in the books care that the wizarding world is so broken and racist?,1673059585

I am currently reading her version of Prisoner of Azkaban (which is so far, the most gripping fanfic I have ever read) and it got me thinking: what if there was an entry for each book in the series featuring a different character? I thought it might be fun to outline some of my ideas and which story elements could be included in each book. Enjoy!

Book 1: 
Ron Weasley and the Black Knight
-the troll attack
-the Mirror of Erised
-sneaking off to Hagrid’s and Norbert
-the third floor corridor

-her heavy crush on Harry Potter
-encounters Moaning Myrtle
-the Chamber of Secrets

Book 3:
Hermione Granger and the Time Turner
This one has already been done justice, albeit with the title, “Hermione Granger and the Prisoner of Azkaban” thanks to SaraSmile416. Her primary storyline goes into great detail on the time turner and the emotional stress it puts on Hermione as she tries to keep everything in order, as well as the toll it takes on her friendships with Harry and Ron, Ginny, and a few others (I won’t spoil too much). Seriously, read it if you like the concept!

Book 4:
Fred and George Weasley and the Faux Galleons (Idk about that title, help me!)
-Ludo Bagman storyline
-Quidditch World Cup and the death eater attack
-attempt on the Goblet of Fire
-experimenting with their joke toys and candies
-starting their Wizard Wheezes business
-witnessing/betting on the tournament
-obtaining the galleons from Harry

Book 5:
Luna Lovegood and the Veil of Mysteries
-meeting Harry Potter
-friendship with Ginny and Neville
-being an outsider in the Ravenclaw house
-the Quibbler
-joining Dumbledore’s Army
-producing a patronus
-thestrals
-adventures in the department of mysteries

Book 6:
Draco Malfoy and the Vanishing Cabinet
-father going to prison
-his task given by Voldemort
-exploring his relationship with Narcissa
-petrifying Harry on the Hogwarts Express
-attempts on Dumbledore’s life (such the necklace and the wine bottle)
-sneaking into Slughorns party
-relationship with Snape
-inner turmoil with realizing he is not the person he thought he was
-Sectumsempra curse
-Mending the cabinet

Book 7:
Neville Longbottom and the Sword of Gryffindor
-Bill and Fleur’s wedding
-going to Hogwarts under Snape as headmaster
-dealing with the Carrows
-growing as a leader and person
-friendships with Ginny and Luna
-bringing Dumbledore’s Army back
-alliance with Aberforth Dumbledore
-Luna being taken by Death eaters
-the battle of Hogwarts
-pulling the sword out of the hat

harrypotter,"Voldemort was cruel and twisted and would hurt anything and sacrifice anyone to get what he wanted (and particularly to get to live forever).  He also undoubtedly hurt and killed more people than Umbridge since he was directing his deatheaters and  the whole Ministry (including her) after the Ministry fell.

But somehow this little pink-dressing middle-aged witch who was into child abuse, sadism and controlling just about everything, seemed much much worse to me.  This was especially true when  she said and did awful terrible things to people in a sweet innocent voice as if she were a kindly reception teacher.

I suspect it is the vicious wickedness hidden inside visual and social cues which we normally associate with kindness which turns my stomache.

Harry and Ron are doing their divination homework assigned to them early, and though they are joking, they make accurate predictions of the major events in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Harry’s first prediction is that he will have a risk of getting burnt, the first task involved dragons. Ron’s prediction was that he would lose something most cherished, the second task ended up, having Ron kidnapped as as Harry’s most prized possession by the influence of mercury, Mercury = merpeople. The third prediction involved Harry getting betrayed by someone he thought as a friend,this could represent two things, Viktor Krum’s betrayal in the maze, or more importantly, Mad Eye Moody’s “betrayal” in disguise by Barty Crouch Junior. Harry thought of Moody as a mentor and helper by the end. The final prediction before they continued their homework, Harry says that he will come out worse in a fight at the end.

Since I started working on it, whenever I think of Rose Weasley's character I can't imagine her being white, I don't know why, maybe because of the actress chosen in the play. So my mind totally gave birth on its own to a headcanon with Rose Granger-Weasley being adopted by Ron and Hermione, while Hugo is their biological son. And so, as a result, I imagined her inner conflict with her mother, her having to be perfect all the time because she has an inferiority complex and doesn't want to disappoint her parents' expectations, the various problems she might get into by being the only one really ""different"" in a family of redheaded white people. I don't know, now I can't get out of it. When I was drafting the outline of the story all this was not contemplated, but now every time I come back to it it seems impossible not to write it that way.

What about reactive armour with layers which would be destroyed by the unforgivables and other major spells while protecting the wearer ? Having a large amount of shrunken Shields that would be automatically unshrunken and fixed on your hand when one is destroyed ? Bludgers who are enchanted to aim incoming spells ?

Fred and George have demonstrated that enchanted clothes can be usefull for minor spells. And they only use a simple Protego enchantment, nothing more powerfull.

Hermione ran forward and pulled the hat onto her head.  She heard a tickly little voice musing aloud.

""A lot of native intelligence here, very clever and keen.  Ravenclaw might suit you well...""

Hermione wondered if the hat could hear her worrying about her future prospects.

""Yes, of course.  We're both in here for the moment.  You know, keenness doesn't really cover it.  You might be better placed in Slytherin.  You're more ambitious than most and they could use...""

For her part, Professor McGonagall thought the Longbottom matriarch had odd ideas about how to raise a child but, having no children of her own, couldn't be entirely certain.  She lowered the hat onto Neville's head, and it dropped right down over his eyes.

""Ho, Longbottom!  It's been a while since I last spoke to a member of your family.  Keeping well, are they?""

*Um,* Neville began.

""Never mind, boy, just breaking the ice.  Oh, dear.""  The hat paused and Neville felt the strangest sensation that there was a mind inside his head, a mind besides his own, actually looking around.  ""Oh, dear.  You poor kid.  Oh, wait...""

If asked in the moment, Neville would have described it as feeling as if some mental boxes had been shifted aside.

""You'd make a good Hufflepuff, you know.  Professor Sprout and you will get along swimmingly.""

*But my gran says Huffs are a bunch of duffers and it's probably the best i can do.*

""Your gran doesn't have the insight on you that I do,"" grumbled the hat quietly, as a few cerebral closets were opened and gently sorted.  ""Oh.  Oh!""

*What?*

""GRYFFINDOR!""

*What?  Are you sure?*

""Never been surer, kid.  Off you go, GRYFFINDOR!""

A few more students came and went with somewhat less drama, until...

""Malfoy, Draco.""

The hat came down over Malfoy's sneer as he waited for it to confidently tell him and the rest of the school what he knew was coming, but the voice inside his head surprised him.

""Hufflepuff.""

*What?!  NO!  My father will...I'm supposed to be a Slytherin, like my father!  You don't know what it's like...*

""No, lad, YOU don't know what it's like.  Huff House is full of good people from all walks of life, far more socially conscious than you are, I daresay, and you would benefit from meeting and getting to know them.  Open your eyes a little.""

Hi, I was recently playing on Potterworld (Java edition) and was intrigued by the way casting spells there works. Basically, you right click your wand and the spells appear on your hotbar. If you press Q it changes hotbar. Then, if you select the spell with a number or right click it from the inventory, the spell is selected and left clicking with the wand will cast it. 

So, I wonder if something like that is doable in MCBE world. 

I'm fully aware that some things are not doable in BE and using only commands, so I'll change something. 

First, hotbars. In BE you can use the /replaceitem just fine to make the player have a certain hotbar, so I'd use that or /give to give the player the items. However, unlike on Java, you can't save hotbars, so there's no way to know the hotbar that the player had BEFORE having the spells one selected to restore it. A solution to this might be simply having the world only for that purpose and nothing else, so the player wouldn't even have other stuff in the hotbar. 

To activate spells, I'd drop items. The dropped item would cause the spell to happen, but here's a problem:

For those unaware of the game mechanics, the player has a finite amount of time in the game where you play out almost every day in a calendar year. The main part of this is going to school, meeting up with your friends for various story beats, and actually doing the classes themselves. This involves certain days where the player is quizzed by the teacher or taking final exams. The character has to balance school, personal development and relationships on top of investigating murders, for example.

Although one of my favorite characteristics of Dumbledore is his near unbreachable sense of calm, and how he keeps a level head in dire times, when others are susceptible to emotions and rash judgement. But the times where he shows hints of impatience and even anger to things he sees as injustice really bring out the human in him. I'm disappointed these parts were often cut out in movies and replaced with things like ""HARRY DID YOU PUT YOUR NAME IN THE GOBLET OF FIRE??!!!"" because those outburst don't convey the power and the same type of feel that these lines brought, just that the screenwriters know nothing about Dumbledore.

harrypotter,"1.
I thought of a story where they are all alive and hermione is actually Sirius’ biological daughter. Although i loves this character madly, he actually acts like an overgrown child and therefore plays his role as Harry’s godfather but doesn’t want to become a father. Hermione’s mother leaves her in front of Sirius’s house and he, against the will of the other marauders who were also willing to adopt her personally and raise her as their own daughter, decides to give her up for adoption because he doesn’t want to be her father and he didn’t want responsibility. He wanted to enjoy life as a man without problems and when he takes her in his arms for the first time at the request of the marauders he doesn’t feel that feeling that every father should feel, which James felt with Harry, but just feels an enormous weight on his shoulders but, he calls her Hermione before leaving her at the muggle orphanage because he knew a muggle name would make his mother turn in her grave and that’s why she calls herself by a short name because she didn’t want anything from the man who had left her without caring. They meets years later at the station when everyone is accompanying Harry for his first year and again when Harry invites her over to his house for the holidays having become great friends with the brilliant but silent little girl who has a morbid obsession with playing by the rules. They slowly learns more about her life and that to adopt Hermione was a horrible family that mistreats her, especially her adoptive father who punishes her whenever she doesn’t follow the rules, and then Sirius repents and tries to bond with his daughter and raise her and things like that. Obviously it will be a difficult path and Sirius will have to live with remorse but as soon as he sees her exactly as he was at her age, alone and with few friends he can really call his family, unwanted without knowing why by both of her biological parents and hated by the foster ones, he feels that feeling he hadn’t felt many years ago when he first picked her up. Hermione had his eyes, his hair, his instilled spirit rebellious and loyal to the point of error and that girl, little but strong as a lion, was his responsibility, she was a child, his child, and he had disappointed her already too much. If I weren’t so bad at writing I would do it but I leave the idea here in case someone wants to use it tell me because I would really be happy to read this fanfic.  

2. 
Hermione is the daughter of Sirius and after the end of the war and discovering the truth about her father she goes back to the past to change the future, to save lives, families. She becomes friends with the Marauders, initially suspicious, even if Sirius immediately feels a strange sensation towards her, as if his world suddenly depends on the smile of a little girl who he knows very well he doesn’t love, not the way adults love themselves but the way he saw James’ parents love him, until they see Hermione’s scar. She meets her father, who died before knowing that she was his daughter, and eventually Sirius discovers that Hermione is his biological daughter from the future and for the first time in his life, this life, he had a family that was his own.","Harry Potter FanFiction idea, again, because no one thinks of me so please,pleaseeeeeeees, If anyone wants to write it, let me know.",1672964273

Instead, he takes the full blame which would have had him sent to Azkaban if he had chosen to Surender to the Minister. And the ministry uses this to undermine him. 

I guess my question is could Dumbledore have known as early as OoTP that he would be dead before Voldemort was defeated and that Harry would need the support of the wizarding world to win, and therefore take the blame to keep Harry's 'reputation' from being besmirched? or was he just shielding Harry from whatever punishment the ministry might have for him?",Did Dumbledore know he would not see the end of Voldemort,1672958491

harrypotter,"While obviously I think her end goal of giving house elves fair working conditions was the right one. She was too self righteous to actually listen to what the elves themselves wanted.

And she's probably right when she says that the elves think that way because they've been conditioned to, but that doesn't change the fact that it's counter intuitive to want to force them to be free. I think that's the point Hagrid and Ron and everyone else is trying to make when they try to talk her out of it. We see that ultimately none of them agree with house elves being mistreated and enslaved, they just don't think Hermione will be able to set them free if they don't want to be free.

She got too greedy with her short and long term goals. Instead of getting them wages her short term goal probably should've been to pass legislation to ensure they're not mistreated, then hopefully elves would start realizing their value and want and seek freedom for themselves, just like it happened with Dobby. We see how fair treatment does so much to improve their lives with Dobby and Kreacher. Her long term goals should've been getting them fair wages, and it's a goal the elves themselves should help her with or want to help her with.

It's an interesting conundrum that shows that the right thing maybe obvious sometimes but that doesn't mean everyone will see that way, and that doesn't mean the solution is equally as obvious.

It is such a ridiculous question and I don't just mean because wizards basically shun anything that is a muggle-specific invention or because they would be able to cast enchantments to protect themselves, but because it takes away from what is supposed to be a magical world. I enjoy Harry Potter because it allows me to escape into another world. Is that world perfect? Of course not. Does it have parallels to the real world? Absolutely.  

But adding guns to that world doesn't add anything to the experience. If anything it takes away from it. The worst curses in the Wizarding Universe can't just be used at will. They require intent (""You have to mean it"") to be effective. So to kill someone, you have to *want* to kill them. To torture someone you have to *want* to cause pain. I think this distinction is important because it provides more insight into the motivations and qualities of the characters. 

Harry tries to torture Bellatrix but his curse isn't successful because he's not the type of person that would want to torture someone. This distinction is what makes the characters in Harry Potter so relatable. We have all had moments where we let ourselves be ruled by our emotions, but we don't act on the thoughts we might have because that's not who we truly are and reason takes over.

harrypotter,I dont know whether this has beeen mentioned before but i think an all or nothing quidditch series will be a great idea as a non controversial spin-off.

It would maybe involve characters like Oliver wood or other quidditch players from the books. it would be canon using a real team like puddlemere united but it doesn't effect the main movies at all and would just be a fun spin-off and that gives more insight to quidditch and wizarding world sports culture.

Now that isnt enough, a year later, that damn Aunt literally gets blown up and drifts away in the sky.

The sixth year isnt as bad (I mean, how could it be?), Dumbledore visits and embarasses you, But at that point, you are living in constant fear of magic anyway.

harrypotter,"In the 21st century?

After what happened with the Second Wizarding war, perhaps its smart for it to become an option if the Auror chooses, to be trained in the art of firearm usage/safety.  I'm not talking about rifles or shotguns, but concealed handguns.  For the most part, the Auror still acts as an Auror usually does, and still uses magic/wand.

But knowing how to use a handgun efficiently and keeping it hidden from potential enemies, could be beneficial.  From what we know about Dark Wizards, they don't use muggle weapons.  If confronted by a dark wizard, a handgun could be a surprise towards the dark arts user.  Giving the good guys an edge.  Combing the art of wielding magic well with knowledge/wand and the advantages a handgun has.

harrypotter,"People are always on about how the films removed this and cut out that or whatever, and even me included too. I love the books and some scenes deserve to be set in the big screen, but what about things that were never in the books? And was only in the films. Just to clarify, when i mean additions, i don't mean changes. Like the film didn't add harry killing quirrel, they just changed it. And this isn't all of the things they actually added, just some of the worst i believe.

POA is widely considered like the best of the franchise, and i honestly could never see it. At best it's bad and at worst is terrible. But when thinking about it, there's one thing i usually used to overlook, and that is lupin. I never really considered about him that much, but recently i made a post about him, and it got me thinking. Why do they add him talking about lily so much? It makes no sense and it kinda feels like he had a thing for her or something, but why would he? He barely says a word about lily in the books? Comes completely out of nowhere. It's like it's a complete 180 of his character, he loves james simple as that, where was lily? Yeah, nowhere.

HBP is like the complete opposite of POA, everyone pretty much knows it sucks and yeah they're right. This film is complete doo doo. And this one has not just one bad addition but more, and one of them concerns the character of slughorn. And again, his relationship with lily. I don't know why people say they prefer his story about the fish in the film? I never really gelled with it and find it kinda dumb. Like in the books he tells about him what about happened that night his parents died, which is so much more impactful. We rarely get to even really see the truth about what happened his parents died, and in the next book we actually see it happened. And it's a shame, because it feels like it's left forgotten in the films.

But oh know HBP couldn't just help itself, and added an even dumber addition, the burning of the burrow. This one makes like absolutely no sense. Not only is not even canon, not only is it never brought up, not only does it take away one of the best highlights of the book with harry and scrimgeour in the burrow during this time in the book, we also get that stupid scene harry and ginny. It's so baffling and just completely useless. Like the next time we see the burrow, it's completely fine and is never brought up again. It's like you never fred or george be like ''ah man this shit reminds of the time the burrow burned down'' or something like that idk. And also not just that, it looks completely ugly af. The stupid ass shaky cam hurts my eyes so much and gives me chronic diarrhea.

And that brings me to another scene that also has some stupid shaky cam, and isn't in the books, that horrible chase scene in DH part 1. I honestly even forgot about this and wasn't even going to mention it, but that doesn't it mean it can get off scot free. This shit is just so like just dumb. THEY COULD EASILY JUST APPARATE AWAY! AND I CAN'T EVEN SEE WHAT'S GOING ON! AND HOW DO THE SNATCHERS EVEN FIND THEM!? WHAT! I'm sorry, i'm usually not like this when watching films, but this just is just so stupid and makes no sense at all.

And we're still on the same film, because guess what, it even get's worse. That stupid ass dance scene with harry and hermione. And before anyone says this is just some dumb shit between friends, even emma watson said in an interview, she saw this scene as like something that could happen between friends and like they both think they could be something more. And even the next scene hermione and harry look into their eyes lovingly, and even she also says ''what if we just grow old together''. And also the fact that they cut out this line, that pretty much ended the harry/hermione debate and if they would end up together:

*“After you left,” he said in a low voice, grateful for the fact that Ron’s face was hidden, “she cried for a week. Probably longer, only she didn’t want me to see. There were loads of nights when we never even spoke to each other. With you gone . . .” He could not finish; it was only now that Ron was here again that Harry fully realized how much his absence had cost them. “She’s like my sister,” he went on. “I love her like a sister and I reckon she feels the same way about me. It’s always been like that. I thought you knew.”*

I like the song they're dancing to at least, but other than that, that scene is just there to give harmione shippers some a wet dream or whatever. And it even stings ever harder because the scene before this, is quite possibly the worst scene in all of HP canon (not tcc), harry and ron's fight. This shit is so baffling and just downright idiotic. And especially the line, ''your parents are dead! YOU HAVE NO FAMILY!'' Like book ron would never outright or even come close to saying something like that, that shit is on another level of bad. It's just mind boggling the extent that these films would go to antagonize ron and demonize him, they spend all of their stupid ass camping scene montage or whatever, to facilitate that there might be something between harry and hermione and ooh ron's jealous or whatever. It's useless they're just building up for this stupid fight for half the movie and it's just a complete joke. It's like it's memed so much to the point where it really is a joke at this point. I hate this scene with all my heart, and yeah maybe it's a changed scene, but the entire point of the fight is different from the book, and the film just again, makes up some dumbass BS.

That's all i could remember honestly, there might be alot more. Just to be clear, i'm not saying an adaptation shouldn't add nothing or whatever, should stick 100% to it? Nah, where's the fun in that. But just adding dumbass shit and making up complete nonsense like these examples, isn't any better. In my next post i do want to discuss a scene where i think the films do something right, by actually adding something that wasn't in the book.

At the beginning, he clearly sees its twin through the window in Borgin and Burkes and later he shares a conversation about it with Mr Weasley.

harrypotter,"Upon a current reread of the series, I find similarities between Harry Potter and Hindu Mythology. At the same time, Rowling pulled elements from the Christian mythos for her books and some from other myths. Some parts of the series speak to me as an Indian reading the series. Let me start with the apparent similarities between the story elements of Harry Potter and famous Indian mythological stories. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Prophecy that Harry must kill Voldemort bares similarities to the story in the Bhagavatam of how an evil king named Kansa received a premonition that the eighth nephew of his would be his killer. While in Harry's case, it was the same except with Voldemort, and how did the two react? 

&amp;#x200B;

Kansa went on a murder spree, killing seven of his nephews before the eighth, a reincarnation of Lord Vishnu himself, and escaped his clutches in the form of Krishna, and Voldemort began targeting the Potters. While in Harry's case, something similar happens when he destroys Voldemort as a baby for the time being, losing his parents in the process. While this is one of the more apparent similarities I have noticed, the trope of a chosen hero or chosen one is quite common in stories.  

&amp;#x200B;

The second thing that struck me was the same scenario in the Mahabharat that led to the death of a famous warrior called Abimanyu was almost the same as the maze in the fourth book. The first is that Harry, like Abimanyu, had to cross a maze to reach the centre of it. In both cases, they found themselves fighting for their lives while no one else could see what was transpiring inside the maze. Finally, both cases ended with some form of tragic circumstances, with Harry's being that he saw Cedric Diggory get killed and Voldemorts return, and Abimanyu lost his life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, Dumbledore's character and Voldemorts resemble the characters of Shakuni and Lord Krishna from the Mahabharata. Especially both are the only ones that can counter the other schemes and plans. Eventually, leading to the death of the other; however, in Dumbledore's case, he dies trying to bring down Voldemort. At the same time, Dumbledore's death and the fall of Bhisma, the grandsire of the dynasty that is the centre of the Mahabharata, are almost the same.

&amp;#x200B;

 Given that many people stop to grieve the loss of both, at the same time, Dumbledore being unable to stop the rise of Voldemort for the second time is an uncanny similarity to how Bhisma was unable to stop the war that is the centrepiece of an Indian epic called the Mahabharata from happening.

&gt;As Dumbledore spoke, Harry heard a rustle behind him and rather‬ thought Kingsley whispered something. He could have sworn too that‬ he felt something brush against his side, a gentle something like a‬ draft or bird wings, but looking down he saw nothing there.‬
…
&gt;‪“Miss Edgecombe,” said Umbridge at once, “tell us how long these‬ ‪meetings have been going on, dear. You can simply nod or shake your‬ ‪head, I’m sure that won’t make the spots worse. Have they been happening regularly over the last six months?”‬ Harry felt a horrible plummeting in his stomach. This was it, they‬ ‪had hit a dead end of solid evidence that not even Dumbledore would be able to shift aside…‬
…
‪&gt;Everyone in the room was gazing at the top of Marietta’s face. Only‬ ‪her eyes were visible between the pulled up robes and her curly fringe.‬ ‪Perhaps it was a trick of the firelight, but her eyes looked oddly blank.‬
‪&gt;And then — to Harry’s utter amazement — Marietta shook her head.‬
‪&gt;Umbridge looked quickly at Fudge and then back at Marietta.‬ ‪“I don’t think you understood the question, did you, dear? I’m asking whether you’ve been going to these meetings for the past six‬ ‪months? You have, haven’t you?”‬
‪&gt;Again, Marietta shook her head.‬
‪“What do you mean by shaking your head, dear?” said Umbridge‬ ‪in a testy voice.‬
&gt;‪“I would have thought her meaning was quite clear,” said Professor‬ ‪McGonagall harshly. “There have been no secret meetings for the past‬ ‪six months. Is that correct, Miss Edgecombe?”‬
‪&gt;Marietta nodded.‬
&gt;‪“But there was a meeting tonight!” said Umbridge furiously.‬ ‪“There was a meeting, Miss Edgecombe, you told me about it, in the‬ ‪Room of Requirement! And Potter was the leader, was he not, Potter‬ ‪organized it, Potter — why are you shaking your head, girl?”‬
&gt;‪“Well, usually when a person shakes their head,” said McGonagall‬ ‪coldly, “they mean ‘no.’ So unless Miss Edgecombe is using a form of‬ ‪sign language as yet unknown to humans—”‬
‪&gt;Professor Umbridge seized Marietta, pulled her around to face her,‬ ‪and began shaking her very hard.‬
…
&gt; ‪Marietta was standing exactly where Umbridge had released her.‬ ‪She seemed neither perturbed by Umbridge’s sudden attack, nor relieved by her release. She was still clutching her robe up to her oddly‬ ‪blank eyes, staring straight ahead of her. A sudden suspicion connected to Kingsley’s whisper and the thing he had felt shoot past him‬ ‪sprang into Harry’s mind.‬

(this is copied and paraphrased a bit from ch27. i hope my mobile formatting is okay.)

now, i always assumed that he’d confunded her. perhaps even obliviated her. but on a recent reread, i realized that a confundus charm’s purpose is to *confuse.* it does not make you do what the caster wants you to or believe what they want you to believe, unless they instruct you verbally perhaps (we never see this happen, but it’s implied by snape in PoA and DH when he uses the confundus as a reason to discredit people that you can use it to convince someone of incorrect information). so why is marietta shaking her head here, rather than agreeing with umbridge? why is she so blank and docile and nonreactive?

harry gets “a suspicion” as to what’s been cast, indicating he finds this behaviour familiar, recognizable. at this point, he has never seen anyone confunded. i checked with potter-search.com and at that point, the confundus has only been referenced: by snape in PoA, and by barty in GoF. the first time we see someone confunded on-page is mclaggen in HBP: he goes “lumbering off in the wrong direction” and is confused and stumbling about knocking into things for the rest of the day. he doesn’t lose awareness. nothing like marietta, who’s not confused at all. she’s calm and cooperative. harry saw plenty of that in “moody’s” defense class in GoF.

Harry potter has some of the best selling books of all time, something like that is hard to compare to, especially when there are hundreds and hundred of other books extremely well made that dont even come close, sure its harry potter and that but when you think of ""harry potter"" you think of Daniel Radcliffe, not harry potters kids, its just become so iconic and well chiseld into our brains a new franchise would be overlooked and wouldnt be able to compare.

My second reasoning is what story would there be to tell, she says its gonna be about the aftermath and people really want to see it but the story kinda ended at that moment, it would be hard to introduce a new villain as there are not really any others mentioned and it wouldnt be very creative, sure there are other worlds in the wizarding universe but why not just make a new story not a hp one.

My last reason is targeted audience, it would be very hard to do as older people or anyone above 10 really would find the original franchise to be to good and nostalgic to be surpassed and the newer generations with the world is advancing would be alot more put off because of jk being transphobic which caused massive backlash

harrypotter,"I don't have a bad opinion of Slytherin house. I can find the given value in every Hogwarts house. In Ravenclaw, for example, knowledge, the desire to know and the love of science. In Hufflepuff, honesty, integrity and honor. In Gryffindor, determination, courage, strength and loyalty. And in the Slytherin house, cunning, ingenuity, ambition, willingness to act and dedication.

I respect all houses equally, but I feel that for some reason the Slytherin house is considered by many people to be the worst and most evil house to belong to. After all, those malicious and evil people who basically do not even deserve the epithet ""human"" end up in this house. Perhaps they are not worthy of being placed in another Hogwarts house based on their own limitations, cowardice, weakness, stupidity and evil and malicious violent, psychopaths behavior. In this way, they spoil the Slytherin reputation and everyone identifies the Slytherin house with these people.

(I have often wondered why there isn't a fifth house, where the useless, incapable of living, or the evil and perverted good-for-nothings are assigned? The name of this house could be MOSGLAMACH. From Old Irish MOSACH; shaggy, rough, bristly bristly, grumpy, surly. And from SGLAMHACH - hungry dog or mastiff - and the animal of the house could be a mad dog with a foaming mouth.)

People with weak abilities, or possibly characterless and infinitely evil people (who are not suitable for any other Hogwarts house due to their inability to live and their inferior character) are just an afterthought.

Apart from them, the Slytherin house could be just as worthy of respect and honor as the other houses. Because not only vile and inferior people came from this house. E.g. Severus Snape - whom I don't think I need to introduce to anyone (I'd rather describe him as a misunderstood, tragic hero), Narcissa Malfoy, who didn't tell Voldemort that Harry Potter was alive, Regulus Black, who was the first to confront Voldemort by stealing his horcrux, or Horace Slughorn - one of my personal favorite characters - who was an extremely utilitarian and calculating man, yet still helped in the fight against Voldemort.

However, there is something about Slytherin house that I still can't wrap my head around to this day. That is, how could a supposedly ""wise wizard"" who is one of the founders of Hogwarts be able to leave a monster for posterity whose task is to destroy innocent children - just because they are ""mudbloods""? I've also read a theory that Salazar did this to protect wizards from traitors who might betray them to the ""muggle inquisitors"" and possibly tell them all the secrets of wizarding society. But I think it's extremely drastic and rude to unleash a Basilisk-level monster on ignorant and innocent children - who know nothing and want no harm. 

This act of Slytherin Salazar basically defined his personality, and it is why everyone considers the Slytherin house to be the most despised house - at least among those who do not belong to it. (E.g.: Everyone at Hogwarts was always cheering against for Slytherin - especially in the Quidditch matches and every Hogwarts houses hated the Slytherin house.) 

The problem is that there is no concrete explanation in the books as to why the founder of the Slytherin house was a potential child killer - which is almost the same level of evil as Voldemort.",What drove Slytherin Salazar to become a child killer and establish Slytherin's bad reputation for generations?,1673538328

It plays a huge part in Deathly Hallows, but I can't remember if this rule is exclusive to the Elder Wand. If it's a rule for all wands, then it'd be pure chaos.

Then D goes for a loo to take pressure off of Horace which enables him to talk freely to Harry. Suddenly wheb D comes back, he strips away the feeling of sentimentality and comfort by saying that they are leaving.

harrypotter,"My girlfriend and I are visiting New York City this weekend and she brought up the idea of seeing grabbing some cheaper last minute tickets to Cursed Child on Broadway. 

A couple years ago I listened to the audiobook of Cursed Child on a long lonely road trip and I honestly didn’t hate it! I didn’t think it was great and had some wtf moments, but as I was driving alone in the dark I was happy to be back in this world. My girlfriend hasn’t read the script or seen the play so everything will be fresh to her. I see it’s now a slimmed down 3 hour show so that has peaked my interest. While it’s hard to find anything positive about Cursed Child on the internet, every review I’ve seen of the stage show has said it’s fantastic, the visuals are stunning and well worth it.

Harry Potter has played a massive role in both our lives and our relationship. I have an extreme case of Dyslexia and the Harry Potter books are what got me to learn to read. As I grew older, Harry learning to cope with his alienation from his peers helped me to cope with the alienation I was feeling. The last couple of years have renewed my interest in the series, turning to the books for solace to help find comfort to confront the adult world. So yes, this series means a lot to me and if this is my one chance to see anything Harry Potter in person, I don’t think it’s something to pass up.

It will also be fitting because I remember I was sitting outside by myself in New York City when I was around 11 or 12 years old when I finished reading Deathly Hallows and was a defining moment of my life. That moment was the first time I really felt myself growing up.

It actually makes more sense for her to take the lead, since Harry's rather shy and unsure of himself, and Ginny has more confidence and experience with dating.

Proof from canon that Ron is a terrible friend.

1. Ron is rude. In Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, when Ron first meets Harry, he asks Harry if he really has the scar and stares at Harry's scar, making Harry uncomfortable.
2. Ron is insensitive. After the Levitation Charm lesson in Sorcerer's Stone, Ron talks mean about Hermione behind her back and makes her go cry in the bathroom. And, no, it wasn't something Ron said to Harry in private, Ron made his mean comments about Hermione in a crowded corridor.
3. Ron approves of murder. In Chamber of Secrets, while discussing why Riddle might have gotten an award for Special Services to the School, Ron says ""maybe he murdered Myrtle, that would have done everyone a favor. So Ron is actually Draco like.
4. Ron has misplaced priorities. In Prisoner of Azkaban, Ron commits the sin of caring more about a pet than a friend. The bottom line is that the falling out between Ron and Hermione in Prisoner of Azkaban is Ron's fault. The reason it is Ron's fault is because of how inappropriately he handled the initial disappearance of Scabbers. Ron was absolutely in the wrong to shake bedsheets in Hermione's face and yell at her in one of the most public settings of Hogwarts, the Gryffindor Common Room. Ron later meanly freezes Hermione out of the food party in the Gryffindor Common Room after their Quidditch win over Ravenclaw. When Harry tries to help Hermione, he yells again and makes poor Hermione run off crying. When confronted by Harry by this, Ron unfairly says ""If she just acted like she was sorry"" The problem with this is that Ron had no right to expect an apology from Hermione for anything unless and until he first apologized to her for shaking bedsheets in her face, yelling at her, and humiliating her in front of the whole common room. Personally, the ONLY way I will EVER apologize to anyone for anything is if the person who feels wronged by me informs me of how they feel they've been wronged by me in a 100% calm, 100% polite, 100% classy, 100% non yelling, and 100% non in your face manner. If someone yells at me, humiliates me, gets in my face, and shakes materials in my face, I will NEVER apologize to them for anything even if it is an indisputable truism that I owe them an apology unless and until they first apologize to me for the yelling, humiliation, in your faceness, etc. Bare in mind that being humiliated is a MUCH worse position to be in than the position Ron was in. Then, later on, Ron won't listen to Hagrid when Hagrid gives his correct perspective that Ron should value his friend more than rats. Remember: FRIENDS SHOULD ALWAYS BE VALUED ABOVE PETS! NO EXCEPTIONS!. Even minor level friendships such as Harry Potter and Katie Bell should always be valued above pets. Harry should care MUCH more about Katie than about Hedwig. Since Ron and Hermione are actually close friends, it's MUCH more true that Ron should care far more about Hermione than about Scabbers. The caveat is this: If Ron would have approached Hermione in a classy and polite manner and informed her of what he thought had happened and what his evidence was in a classy and polite manner, he would then have been justified in expecting an apology from Hermione. Here's what Ron should have done: He should have left the bedsheets in the dorm, calmly approached Hermione in the common room, and asked her for a word. He should then have asked her to follow him up to his dorm and talked to her in private. He then should have showed Hermione the bedsheets and cat hairs and explained that Scabbers was gone and that the evidence pointed to Crookshanks eating Scabbers without yelling. Had Ron handled the situation this way and Hermione still completely denied that the evidence pointed to Crookshanks eating Scabbers, Ron would have been MUCH more justified in becoming angry with Hermione after that. But, Ron needed to understand that no one is going to apologize for anything if you yell at them, humiliate them, or shake materials in their face. Acting like that is only going to rile people up and make people angry and defensive. Being yelled at will also freak most people out. While ""friends should always be valued above pets"" is a hill I will forever die on, I would have MUCH more respect for the opinion that Hermione should have apologized to Ron if Ron himself had handled himself in a classy manner like he should have.
5. Ron is untrusting. Ron falls out with Harry in Goblet of Fire because he doesn't doesn't trust Harry enough. After knowing him for three plus years, Ron should know Harry well enough both to know that he would never have put his own name in the Goblet of Fire knowing the extra attention that would bring as Harry hated fame and attention AND that Harry would NEVER go behind his back or exclude him. Ron knows Harry well enough that he should have trusted Harry and not been suspicious of him. If I were Harry Potter, I would never have forgiven Ron for this betrayal and would never have had anything to do with him ever again. After the 1st Task, Harry should have removed Ron from his life and fully embraced his friendship with Hermione, who proved through her loyalty and support after Harry's name came out of the Goblet of Fire that she and not Ron was Harry's true Bestie. If Harry needed more than one best friend he should have become closer with Neville, Ginny, or Luna. Always remember that it is an indisputable truism that Ron was 1000% unjustified in not supporting, not believing, and not trusting Harry here. Always remember that it is an indisputable truism that this falling out was 100% Ron's fault and 0% Harry's fault. Harry literally didn't do anything wrong and Ron had NO legitimate justification for not supporting, believing, and trusting Harry more here.
6. In Order of the Phoenix, Ron is rude to first years in his prefect duty and calls them midgets.
7. In Half Blood Prince, Ron rudely takes an armchair by fire from an innocent first year. (Hermione does the right thing and gives the armchair back to the first year.)
8. Ron is observed to be unkind by Luna. On page 310 of Half Blood Prince, Luna says that Ron is unkind and that she had noticed that last year. Consider the fact that lovely and awesome Luna feels no affection for Ron and thinks him unkind.
9. In Half Blood Prince, Ron is mean to his Quidditch teammates and makes Demzela cry.
10. The worst part of all: Ron is disloyal. Ron literally betrayed and abandoned both Harry and Hermione on the road in the middle of a WAR. When you betray and abandon your two best friends on the road in the middle of a WAR, then you are NOT loyal but are a fair weather friend. You can't blame the Horcrux because both Harry and Hermione were it is well and neither of them ever abandoned each other or the mission. You also can't blame hunger. Neither Harry nor Hermione had any more to eat than Ron did. You can't blame conditions either. Harry and Hermione didn't have any comfortable beds or anything any more than Ron did. Even in general, Harry and Hermione had better attitudes toward the Horcrux Hunt than Ron and both did far less worrying and whining than Ron did. Harry was right on the money when he said that Ron knew he signed up for. Ron knew that the Horcrux Hunt wasn't going to be flowers and chocolates. This was the moment that made Ron 1000% irredeemable and proved for good that Hermione and not Ron was Harry's true Bestie and truly loyal friend. Ron literally betrayed and abandoned both Harry and Hermione on the road in the middle of a WAR. When the going got tough, Ron got going and ditched his friends. That's a fair weather friend for you.

So you know how in the Prisoner of Azkaban movie (especially the first dementor scene on the train to Hogwarts) the screen effect symbolizing the dementor stealing the soul of a person? I am of the opinion that, compared to some of the amazing videography of POA, this was a really poor representation of the effect. 

On the other hand, Sirius laying by the lake at the end of the movie and the soul-mass(?) temporarily exiting/reentering his body was absolutely fantastic. I just really didn't care for the blurry screen effect; it just doesn't seem like the right way to animate it to me.  However, at the same time, I'm not the type of person to ordinarily complain without trying to come up with a better solution and honestly nothing immediately occurs to me as a better portrayal method.

I know that book vs. movie discussion threads are extremely common, and one thing I have noticed is that a lot of people will also discuss how the changes that were made to the movies affected how they felt about a particular character's death as opposed to how they felt when they read the books.  Now, while many people have expressed that the movies lessened the impact of some characters' deaths for them, I am wondering if there are any instances where the movies might have heightened the impact of a character's death.

Personally, I noticed that Hedwig's death actually hit me harder when I watched *Deathly Hallows: Part 1* as opposed to when I read her death in the book.

harrypotter,"During the scenes going back to the Triwizard Tournament, it cuts to the Ludo Bagman commentary that was happening in the background of Goblet of Fire. In that, we get this:

&gt;If you’re from Hogwarts. Give me a cheer.

&gt;If you’re from Durmstrang — give me a cheer

&gt;*There’s a loud cheer*

&gt;AND IF YOU’RE FROM BEAUXBATONS GIVE ME A CHEER

&gt;*There’s a slightly limp cheer*

I’m unsure whether it was just an abysmal attempt at humour in Fleur doing poorest in the tasks, or if the writers genuinely thought there were less people there from Beaxbatons. 

Just to give perspective, Beaxbatons is stated to have a far bigger castle than both Hogwarts and Durmstrang. While some of that might just be for show, you have to take into consideration that ,unlike Hogwarts, Beaxbaton’s general population isn’t only from one country as they house wizards from numerous Central European countries surrounding France. 

Granted, I imagine it’s similar with Durmstrang, but they certainly wouldn’t give off a “limp cheer”.

harrypotter,"A lot of people like to criticize Yates for his work but I personally thought he was one of the better directors for Potter. Im speaking about only his 4 Potter films as I think the FB films weren’t consistent or coherent enough as a story. 

When I look at Yates’s work, I think of camera moving and imagery storytelling. His films, outside of Alfonso Cuaron, felt the most cinematic and emotional of any in the series. In most of his films, he gets great performances from the actors and always has this gritty tone to the films that were needed for the back half of the series. His adaptations were decent but I attribute that to the lack of runtime in the film(s). Him and Steve Kloves had great chemistry together in my opinion. 

If David Yates was around given the option to direct Goblet of Fire, a far better narrative than Order of Phoenix imo, I’m sure we would’ve gotten a more darker and tonally consistent film that Newell’s Goblet of Fire. 

•The Death eater attack would’ve been a little longer. 

•The Dragon chase would be significantly toned down or removed 

•The 3rd task would’ve included more creatures and jump scares for the audience.

I see so many posts of people saying that they go back to the movies to feel good, to feel at home, to be comforted. I don't feel that way.

I need at least a year between two watches of the series.

Personally, I think Warner should do what they seem to be already testing with Hogwarts Legacy: use Hogwarts, but in a different context. If Hogwarts Legacy works, I can see them creating a TV series taking place in Hogwarts, possibly also taking place in a different time period. Maybe the first season could be during Hogwarts's foundation and start from there, with the founders, as the heads of their respective houses, helping Hogwarts studying deal with their struggles, while also dealing with their own struggles.

They could just call it ""Hogwarts"", or, if they want to make the fandom happier, maybe they could call it ""Hogwarts: A History"".

harrypotter,"11 January 2023 - In recent years, the wizarding world has seen a steady increase in international trade and commerce, but sources now suggest that this trend is slowing down.

The Ministry of Magic has reported a decrease in the number of import and export licenses issued for wizarding goods and services, indicating a downturn in international trade. This has caused concern among many in the wizarding community, as international trade has become a crucial aspect of the wizarding economy.

Businesses that rely heavily on international trade, such as the magical instrument industry and the potion-making industry, have reported a significant drop in profits. Many merchants have been forced to lay off workers and reduce production as a result of the decrease in demand for their products.

Experts attribute the slowdown in international trade to several factors, including increasing regulations and tariffs imposed by the Ministry of Magic, as well as tensions between different wizarding nations. Some have also pointed to the ongoing war in the Middle East, which has affected trade routes and made it more difficult for merchants to transport goods.

The Ministry of Magic has assured the wizarding community that they are taking steps to address the issue, but many businesses and individuals are calling for more drastic measures to be taken to boost international trade.

In Philosopher’s Stone, Harry faces the book’s challenge with Ron and Hermione; all of his friend’s support. In Chamber of Secrets, Harry faces the challenge with Ron only, having to leave Hermione behind. In a similar fashion, in Prisoner of Askaban, Harry has to face the book’s challenge with only Hermione, having to leave Ron behind. And finally, in Goblet of Fire, Harry faces the challenge completely alone; showing the growth Harry had to go through from  books 1-4. I think also, and this really is my own theory of Rowling’s intentions, that she wanted to show that end to end, Harry had to face Voldemort alone with his own bravery.

harrypotter,"It's pretty common to talk about how Voldemort has chopped up his soul into a bunch of tiny pieces, and how little he would have left- but I think people have missed quite how bad it is.

As I'm sure many remember, you don't just split your soul when you make a Horcrux- you split it when you murder someone in cold blood, as Slughorn tells Riddle here:

&gt;By an act of evil — the supreme act of evil. By committing murder.  
&gt;  
&gt;Killing rips the soul apart. The wizard intent upon creating a Horcrux would  
&gt;  
&gt;use the damage to his advantage: He would encase the torn portion —”

If we take that entirely at face value, things aren't looking very good for Tom's soul. 

Looking at the number of Inferi in the lake, then let's take 150 as the minimum he killed and 1000 as the maximum. Seems about fair. Then, *at best*, he'll have 151-1001 individual pieces of soul. But it's not quite so simple.

In order to find our real answer, we have to decide how a soul tears (though, in sincerity, I *soul-*ly doubt it's meant to be treated so mathematically). Since there's no way with each given murder to know the total number of murders in the future, there's no reason to split an even piece of each time. So likely no perfect 151-1001 part soul. 

If, each time, a chunk just comes off like a sandwich crumb, then he's probably got a bunch of tiny super mini soul bits floating about. Great to resurrect yourself with those.

But. If it's actually cutting off a half each time, and assuming that each half won't be spared future halving in the future, then after 150 murders he'll have 2\^150,  or seventy quattuordecillion (!!!), individual pieces of soul. 7•10\^46. And if it's 1000 murders, then it'll be in almost a centillion, or \~9•10\^302 different parts. Soooooooo yeah. Big numbers. Very big numbers.

That does seem to explain why his soul was so unstable he made a whole accidental Horcrux.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Some alternate scenarios: 

* Voldemort loses a half each time he makes a Horcrux, but murder alone doesn't split his soul in two. Then, he's only got 1/256th remaining.
* Voldemort plans ahead and manages to put about 1/7th in each intentional Horcrux. He still probably ends up splitting the final seventh with Harry, since he gave it up by accident, meaning he and Harry each get 1/14th.
* Peter Pettigrew, when resurrecting him, draws some substantial fraction off of all the Horcruxes, giving him actually a decent restart point.
* Voldemort's soul is no longer a single entity but a sickly buzzing hive of barely connected parts, which no horrible act is even able to damage more.

harrypotter,"Dobby, is practically everyone's favorite character, yet he really gets the short end of the stick in the films. It's like so annoying, and the real reason i could see why they cut him out of the following films we'll discuss, is because they really didn't know any better, or better yet didn't know he would become such a huge and important character later down the line. But is that actually true? By the time the GOF film came out, it was 2005, and the GOF, OOTP, and HBP book already released, and dobby is a prominent character there as well. And when 2007 came about, the books ended and only the OOTP film came out, so why couldn't they have included him in the films before? Is it because they think he's some useless character or something? It's stupid. 

**The Chamber Of Secrets**

Yes, his first appearance to the franchise, really doesn't stick out much. He really just like barely shows up in the film, just in the beginning, middle, and end. Not really much to say here, because even in the book like what does he do? The only thing that really sticks out, is his love of harry tbh. He's so devoted and loyal to him even though he's not even his master, they honestly seem like really good friends, but none of that is really translated in the films tbh. Harry just seems like he doesn't give 2 shits about dobby, and ofc this will become much more apparent later, but even here it feels hfbr3bf yk. 

I also want to talk about his design, and yeah it looks...ugly af. Like i get he's a house elf what more was i expecting, but his design just looks like a wrinkled nutsack tbh. And it's shame they don't have his round glassy tennis ball eyes or whatever. 

Lucius pretty much kills harry and the end of the film, and this is the last we see of dobby, until his eventual demise, but i don't care because he still shows up in the books.

**The Goblet Of Fire**

I remember a while back of something i saw on youtube i think, but it was an easter egg of the GOF film, and in a split second shot you could make it out dobby and winky, during the quidditch world cup scene. And it just makes it even worse why they didn't show up. And i think maybe that's why they didn't want to add dobby? Because they didn't want to have winky? Or something idk i'm really grasping at straws. And it's even more baffling because winky is a great character. Yeah, sure she's an alcoholic mess, but she's really like the driving force for hermione's S.P.E.W obsession and movement. And this scene really shows it.

 *“You may rest assured that she will be punished,” Mr. Crouch added coldly. “M-m-master . . .” Winky stammered, looking up at Mr. Crouch, her eyes brimming with tears. “M-m-master, p-p-please . . .” Mr. Crouch stared back, his face somehow sharpened, each line upon it more deeply etched. There was no pity in his gaze. “Winky has behaved tonight in a manner I would not have believed possible,” he said slowly. “I told her to remain in the tent. I told her to stay there while I went to sort out the trouble. And I find that she disobeyed me. This means clothes.” “No!” shrieked Winky, prostrating herself at Mr. Crouch’s feet. “No, master! Not clothes, not clothes!” Harry knew that the only way to turn a house-elf free was to present it with proper garments. It was pitiful to see the way Winky clutched at her tea towel as she sobbed over Mr. Crouch’s feet. “But she was frightened!” Hermione burst out angrily, glaring at Mr. Crouch. “Your elf ’s scared of heights, and those wizards in masks were levitating people! You can’t blame her for wanting to get out of their way!” Mr. Crouch took a step backward, freeing himself from contact with the elf, whom he was surveying as though she were something filthy and rotten that was contaminating his over-shined shoes. “I have no use for a house-elf who disobeys me,” he said coldly, looking over at Hermione. “I have no use for a servant who forgets what is due to her master, and to her master’s reputation.”*  

She plays such a huge part in the whole crouch storyline, which IMO is really where this book shines. And yes ik this is about dobby, but it feels weird to not at least mention her, because then again, it was because of him she even got a job. But in this book we really see the relationship of him and harry building stronger, especially with the gillyweed.

Okay listen...i get why they cut out him actually giving it, and having neville do it instead, because it made more sense...but it's not like the films made that shit up. That was his original plan in the first place, he wanted harry to ask neville about gillyweed but that failed so he used dobby instead...so why couldn't they just do that instead too? It's like it's the little things that make harry and dobby special yk, even him giving him the stupid sweater he made for him, that's just cute. And even just the fact that again he risked his neck just to help harry, is even better. 

**The Order Of The Phoenix**

Okay replacing dobby with neville last time you had a pass, doing it again nah that's taking it too far. It's like why? Just why? It's so stupid and leaves dobby doing nothing and not even show up in the entire film. And not even just the fact that he doesn't find the room of requirement, nah they take it a step further, and not have him warn harry about umbridge.

 *But he thought he knew — surely only one “she” could induce such fear in Dobby? The elf looked up at him, slightly cross-eyed, and mouthed wordlessly. “Umbridge?” asked Harry, horrified. Dobby nodded, then tried to bang his head off Harry’s knees; Harry held him at bay. “What about her? Dobby — she hasn’t found out about this — about us — about the D.A.?” He read the answer in the elf’s stricken face. His hands held fast by Harry, the elf tried to kick himself and fell to the floor. “Is she coming?” Harry asked quietly. Dobby let out a howl, and began beating his bare feet hard on the floor. “Yes, Harry Potter, yes!” Harry straightened up and looked around at the motionless, terrified people gazing at the thrashing elf. “WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?” Harry bellowed. “RUN!” They all pelted toward the exit at once, forming a scrum at the door, then people burst through; Harry could hear them sprinting along the corridors and hoped they had the sense not to try and make it all the way to their dormitories. It was only ten to nine, if they just took refuge in the library or the Owlery, which were both nearer — “Harry, come on!” shrieked Hermione from the center of the knot of people now fighting to get out. He scooped up Dobby, who was still attempting to do himself serious injury, and ran with the elf in his arms to join the back of the queue. “Dobby — this is an order — get back down to the kitchen with the other elves, and if she asks you whether you warned me, lie and say no!” said Harry. “And I forbid you to hurt yourself!” he added, dropping the elf as he made it over the threshold at last and slamming the door behind him. “Thank you, Harry Potter!” squeaked Dobby, and he streaked off.*  

This is even dumber because now in the film, the entire D.A gets in trouble, whereas in the book they all got off totally unharmed. Which even brings us to very next scene in the film, where they're in dumbledore's office and completely ruin that too. I'm sorry, i'm getting off track the OOTP film is the bane of my existence, and it ruined dobby so it's even worse now.

But oh wait, like GOF this film could't get enough of ruining just one house elf, so they ruined another one...kreacher. I love the fact that harry actually goes to kreacher and asks him if sirius betrayed him, and he doesn't look like a complete idiot for not actually going to check...UNLIKE IN THE FILM! WHERE HE IS. Kreacher is like the complete opposite of dobby, having no respect sirius and pretty much hating his guts. And i understand, he really was the living embodiment of everything he hated with his family's pureblood mania. And even his betrayal is such a crazy ass plot twist, and makes sirius dying even so much more gut-wrenching. And i know this about dobby, but it plays in here too, by removing the character it makes their death much less impactful. Hence, dobby in DH. His death feels unearned and downright cheap and pretty much useless, because all that build-up we had of him and harry's friendship growing and growing over the course of the series, is just completely gone. And at times it also makes him an idiot, like not asking kreacher in the fire about sirius in the film AND...

**The Half-Blood Prince**

Not telling dobby to spy on malfoy. It's literally right there dude, you're so close. Yes, it's not established he even works in hogwarts, but guess what aberforth still called him in malfoy manor, so idk. And i find it hilarious that this homeboy really beat the living hell out of kreacher, and broke some of his teeth because he was talking shit about harry, that's just dedication. 

And that's pretty much all he does for this book...so maybe i'll be lenient and i'll give the film a pass for him cutting him here.

**The Deathly Hallows**

But now reach the penultimate end of whatever idk. Because the films pull a complete 180 and actually include him in the film...YAY but not really. It just feels really rushed and like they're trying to cram in all the missed character moments we had from the books all into 1 scene and it just fails completely, rendering his death scene just completely butchered.

This is honestly one of the best death scenes of the entire series, and it's done beautifully in the book.

 *“Dobby — no — HELP!” Harry bellowed toward the cottage, toward the people moving there. “HELP!”  He did not know or care whether they were wizards or Muggles, friends or foes; all he cared about was that a dark stain was spreading across Dobby’s front, and that he had stretched out his thin arms to Harry with a look of supplication. Harry caught him and laid him sideways on the cool grass. “Dobby, no, don’t die, don’t die —” The elf’s eyes found him, and his lips trembled with the effort to form words. “Harry . . . Potter . . .” And then with a little shudder the elf became quite still, and his eyes were nothing more than great glassy orbs, sprinkled with light from the stars they could not see.* 

Deathly hallows is already a complete bonkers book, with deaths flying left and right and centre, yet dobby's one really just feels like it came out of nowhere and unexpected, and that really adds to the scene rather than take away. I still remember reading the book for one of the first times, and his death really hit me super hard. Like i was literally bawling my eyes out damn. And what's even sadder than him just dying is the scene with his funeral. “

*''There,” she said softly. “Now he could be sleeping.” Harry placed the elf into the grave, arranged his tiny limbs so that he might have been resting, then climbed out and gazed for the last time upon the little body. He forced himself not to break down as he remembered Dumbledore’s funeral, and the rows and rows of golden chairs, and the Minister of Magic in the front row, the recitation of Dumbledore’s achievements, the stateliness of the white marble tomb. He felt that Dobby deserved just as grand a funeral, and yet here the elf lay between bushes in a roughly dug hole. “I think we ought to say something,” piped up Luna. “I’ll go first, shall I?” And as everybody looked at her, she addressed the dead elf at the bottom of the grave. “Thank you so much, Dobby, for rescuing me from that cellar. It’s so unfair that you had to die, when you were so good and brave. I’ll always remember what you did for us. I hope you’re happy now.” She turned and looked expectantly at Ron, who cleared his throat and said in a thick voice, “Yeah . . . thanks, Dobby.” “Thanks,” muttered Dean. Harry swallowed. “Good-bye, Dobby,” he said. It was all he could manage, but Luna had said it all for him. Bill raised his wand, and the pile of earth beside the grave rose up into the air and fell neatly upon it, a small, reddish mound. “D’you mind if I stay here a moment?” he asked the others. They murmured words he did not catch; he felt gentle pats upon his back, and then they all traipsed back toward the cottage, leaving Harry alone beside the elf. He looked around: There were a number of large white stones, smoothed by the sea, marking the edge of the flower beds. He picked up one of the largest and laid it, pillowlike, over the place where Dobby’s head now rested. He then felt in his pocket for a wand. There were two in there. He had forgotten, lost track; he could not now remember whose wands these were; he seemed to remember wrenching them out of someone’s hand. He selected the shorter of the two, which felt friendlier in his hand, and pointed it at the rock. Slowly, under his murmured instruction, deep cuts appeared upon the rock’s surface. He knew that Hermione could have done it more neatly, and probably more quickly, but he wanted to mark the spot as he had wanted to dig the grave. When Harry stood up again, the stone read:* ***HERE LIES DOBBY, A FREE ELF.***  

Just the fact that he thought dobby deserved just as a grand funeral as dumbledore, really speaks to what i've been talking about this entire post, their friendship. That's what really matters, and that magic is really completely lost in the films. Even his last words don't feel earned at all in the films. In the books it's simple, it's just ''harry potter'', because that's all he needed to say, his actions spoke louder. Like him saving harry with the gillyweed, his present with the baubles he presented in the ROR, his crazy ass sweater he gave harry, warning him about umbridge, and even beating up kreacher because he talked shit about his boy, that's dobby, and all of that is lost in the films, and makes his death way less impactful. Both DH films always felt weird to me, in ways i couldn't really articulate, everything just felt, like less impactful and especially the death's. And i now i know why, it's not built up or set up. And that's the problem, you don't build off characters to just have them to die, you develop them first and then kill them, but it just felt the filmakers went the opposite way, and had the intent to kill him first, and didn't care about developing him because they just thought they were going to die in the end, so who cares. It's that level of carelessness that really shows in character's like dobby. And this happens all the time, just read this post again and replace dobby with sirius and it would pretty much be the same, or maybe even lupin too. But for now, it's dobby's turn for the spotlight. 

**In Conclusion**

I always feel like nobody really cared about dobby in the films tbh, like the only time he's actually mentioned is just like how it's better than neville gave him the gillyweed or whatever. But i feel like even in the films too, they really just didn't care about him. And it's not like he's some underrated nothing character, no he's prominent enough to get killed off spectacularly and plays major roles in the last few books. He doesn't get the respect he really deserves man, he honestly deserved so much better. And kreacher too man my god, how come he didn't show up in the end of the battle of hogwarts, such a missed opportunity. But then again, pretty much everything that has to do with dobby is a missed opportunity in the films. Also people who say kreacher had a better character arc than dobby? Like what was dobby's character arc? Huh? He loved harry through and through and really didn't change that much as a character. Whereas kreacher actually changed drastically and went from just hating harry's guts to serving faithfully and lovingly. Not really even related that much, but i just like it had to be said.",Dobby Really Deserved Better In The Films.,1673391091

harrypotter,"Don’t get me wrong all three were very good and solidified how I imagined the book versions of their characters going forward but which one fit their part most? 

I think it comes down to who your favorite character is. For me i thought Rupert Grint was the best cast. 

I thought he was the best of the three in the first couple of movies (“why can’t we follow the butterflies?” cracks me up) and starting with PoA it was about even. Ron was dealt dirty in the movies though and I attribute this to the scriptwriter. 

Harry i think is pretty close to the book version minus the sarcastic quips that were in the book.  We kind of got this in in Half Blood Prince with the Felix Felicis sequence but overall he’s more of a straight man, stereotypical hero character.

For Hermione I think the issue is that the movies made her feel more like Harry’s best friend than Ron did, which again I attribute to the scriptwriter. She also comes across to me as more bossy in the movies than in the books and I don’t know if it’s due to the script or Emma Watson’s direction.

harrypotter,"It's not exactly a secret that Warner Bros has seen better days. Amid a series of massive corporate reshufflings, and a string of unexpected box office flops, WB has made some HUGE decisions in the last year or so. 

While most of the attention has been put on DC, the Wizarding World franchise has also gone through some changes. Most namely, the cancellation of the Fantastic Beasts franchise. Secrets of Dumbledore is at least for now, the last Wizarding World movie, with the last two Fantastic Beasts movies no longer in production. 

However, this begs the question: What can WB do to make this a profitable film franchise again? Well, here is how I think they should go about it. 

**Albus Potter and the Cursed Child**

Now it's not exactly a secret that this project has been in consideration for some time now, however I think it would be the best direction to go. At least for right now. 

While the play was not very good at all (at least IMO), I think that a movie could fix some of the problems. 

I'd go with an entirely new villain, who isn't related to Voldemort or Bellatrix. Someone looking to maybe take the best aspects of Grindelwald and Voldemort and try to accomplish what they couldn't. Maybe, this new villain could be the same age as Albus and Scorpius, allowing for a new dynamic that we haven't seen before. A Wizarding World villain that's the same age as the main characters. 

I would most likely eliminate the time travel plotline, since I think that the time-turners should remain a rare item that's almost never seen. Maybe this idea could be explored in the future, but for a first movie, it's just not a good idea at all. 

Also, this is a no-brainer for me, but I'd bring back the original actors from the first 8 films to play their older selves. And yes, this does include Emma Watson, since it wouldn't make sense for Hermione to be a different race in this franchise. 

This could be the first in a new series of films, or it could be a one-and-done. But after the Fantastic Beasts franchise failed to appeal to casual audiences (and even hardcore fans), I think a big title like this would be the best way to bring attention back to this franchise. Just do what Disney did with Star Wars but do it better than they did. 

**The Marauders**

I'd make this the first TV show of the franchise, following a young James Potter, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew, and their various misadventures at Hogwarts. We could also see a lot of other younger versions of characters, such as Snape, Lily, Lucius, Bellatrix, Narcissa and Regulus. Not to mention all of the professors. 

This could be a much lower stakes show, simply focusing on relationship drama, teen angst and anxiety, and the meaning of friendship. However, we could also see the beginning of the Death Eaters and see a transition into the first Wizarding War against Voldemort. Ideally, I'd have the show end with Voldemort being defeated in Godric's Hollow, Lily and James being killed and Sirius being arrested. 

**The Founders**

This would either be a movie or a mini-series, and would follow the four founders of Hogwarts, and their early struggles with running the school. We'd see how they all first came together, how various aspects of the school were decided, and the eventual falling out between Salazar Slytherin and the rest of the founders. 

If this movie/series is a success, then I would leverage the popularity of it, to make a sequel based on the founding of Ilvermorny in America. I don't think it would be fair to completely ditch the American side of this world, just because of Fantastic Beasts' failure. Speaking of:

**Dumbledore and Grindelwald**

This trilogy would COMPLETELY retcon the Fantastic Beasts' trilogy out of existence and give us the version of this story that we should've gotten in the first place. We get to see Dumbledore's tough upbringing, his relationship/friendship with Grindelwald, and the eventual duel between them and Aberforth that would cost Aurelia her life. 

The second movie would be about Albus travelling the world and making a name for himself, eschewing the naive and bitter personality he would've had in the first film. Grindelwald would meanwhile be building his own band of supporters.

The third film would finally see the famous duel between the pair, ending with Dumbledore detaining his former love and sending him to Azkaban where Voldemort would later find him in Deathly Hallows Part 2. 

**Other possible projects**

* Goblin wars show
* **Young Voldemort movie/show**
* Squib project (about finding purpose despite not being able to use magic)
* **Ministry of Magic/MACUSA show (very political and basically the HP equivalent of Andor)**",How I'd fix the Wizarding World movie franchise,1673385465

harrypotter,"I, personally, feel that Snape and Lily knowing each other was random and just pulled out randomly. I think Rowling could have added a few small hints throughout the books for rereads as she did for the other books' plot twists.

Okay, so now for where I think she could have added a hint. In OotP, Draco Malfoy insults Harry's mother causing Harry to be banned from quidditch by Umbridge. 

\&gt;“Or perhaps,” said Malfoy, leering as he backed away, “you can remember what your mother’s house stank like, Potter, and Weasley’s pigsty reminds you of it —”

I think it would have been cool if Snape was either on the field and reacted after Harry attacked Malfoy of course so the story could continue. Maybe Snape did not stop Malfoy from getting hurt like Harry expected and just stared with a sneer.  Or maybe instead of Snape being on the field,  McGonagall told Snape when Snape asked and Snape gave Malfoy detention.

They found an unpleasant-looking silver instrument, something like a many-legged pair of tweezers, which scuttled up Harry’s arm like a spider when he picked it up, and attempted to puncture his skin. Sirius seized it and smashed it with a heavy book entitled Nature’s Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy. There was a musical box that emitted a faintly sinister, tinkling tune when wound, and they all found themselves becoming curiously weak and sleepy, until Ginny had the sense to slam the lid shut; a heavy locket that none of them could open; a number of ancient seals; and, in a dusty box, an Order of Merlin, First Class, that had been awarded to Sirius’s grandfather for services to the Ministry.

harrypotter,"I've seen the play in San Francisco and read the script. The story is fantastic. It had been 19 years since the Second War. In 19 years, muggles had invented computers that work as phones that fit in our pockets, self-driving cars, etc etc. In 19 years, it's entirely feasible that Time-Turners were reinvented and improved in the wizarding world. Draco is the inventor and despite his character arc in the harry potter stories, we never knew his academic achievements. I can see him being passionate about time travel because he has so many regrets from the past. Hermione is Minister for Magic, of course. Ron works with George at WWW fitting his character. Harry is an Auror, of course. Each of them has grown to become adults in those 19 years, becoming parents, and achieving/giving up on their dreams. They have matured and changed. Most of the opinions hating on the cursed child involve it being ""fan fiction"", the world not following the ""rules"" of the harry potter stories (19 years prior...), and that the characters have changed from their core beliefs (19 years prior...)

It is not ""fan fiction"", it's canon. The author of the story decided that this story was the one that she wanted to include in the canon of the story. It is written by a playwright rather than a young adult fantasy writer. So many of the qualms about the writing or story should simply be because you wanted something different to happen. If Rowling had been the original writer, you would say it was fantastic. The harry potter series is not flawless, there are numerous continuity issues within it regarding the ""rules"" of the wizarding world and the personality of the characters, and she completely caters to the audience she is writing for in the last book, but you do not call that ""fan-fiction"" because she was the writer. 

From 18 years old to 37 years old, most, if not all, people change, drastically. Wisdom is a real thing that occurs over time and each of these characters shows that the way they think is different from being a child. Harry's relationship with Albus is severely strained as many teenager/parent relationships are because the teenager is becoming their own person. 

Delphi being the daughter of Voldemort and Bellatrix is another point of contention. For some reason, people on this subreddit think that Voldemort is incapable or uninterested in sex because it was never mentioned in the harry potter series. Voldemort is a power-crazed dictator who would do anything to survive. He was a psychopath incapable of love or affection. But it is naive to think that sex is attached to love or affection. Sex is a biological function along with any cultural meaning that has been attached to it. Voldemort having sex with Bellatrix is entirely possible, and I would argue is accurate of his character. Bellatrix wanting to have the child of the person she was obsessed with is also a part of her character. It would increase her infamy playing into her ego as the only person to be close enough to the dark lord to have his child. Delphi grew up the same as Harry did. Both parents' true identities were hidden from her, growing up in a house with someone that did not like her, knowing parseltongue, and discovering who she truly was and the prophecy about her in her early teens.

- Grindelwald relied on his skills alone, while Voldemort simply relied on his immortality. Voldemort was very skilled, but he mostly picked enemies much weaker than himself, and tried to avoid his one equally matched wizard (Dumbledore) at all cost. Also Grindelwald managed to subdue the Elder wand, even though he only stole it, while Voldemort didn't.

-Grindelwalds followers were actually loyal to him. They respected him. Only a few Death eaters followed Voldemort out of Loyalty. Most of them followed him, out of fear. That makes Grindelwalds followers much more willing to risk their lives for him, than Voldemorts followers.

harrypotter,"I can't imagine this has never been posted before, but I haven't seen it if it has. But I just love the idea of a Harry and Dudley reunion down the road. 

After the final interaction with the Dursleys, I think we can all agree that Dudley partially redeemed himself. No, it doesn't alleviate all of the mistreatment of Harry over the years alongside Vernon and Petunia. But... He was still a kid when he was extra terrible to Harry and did seem to grow quite a bit after the dementor attack. I'm sure we all were terrible to some degree when we were young, but realizing this and changing for the better (hopefully) is part of growing up, and Dudley seemed to gain some perspective the following couple of years. 

So that brings me to the point of this post: after the amicable farewell between Harry and Dudley in DH, I like to think that the two reunited at some point in the future and even maybe became fond of each other, almost as if they were family... 

I saw a while back a fan fic post about the older crew showing up for Christmas at the Burrow from Mrs. Weasley's loving perspective. In that post, Kreacher was present, indicting a reunion with Harry after the Battle and a positive relationship forming out of an originally negative one. I'd love to see something similar with Harry and Dudley. I know he would probably never want to see Vernon and Petunia again, and vice versa, but I think that Harry and Dudley meeting up at some point and even having children that grew up knowing their cousins on that side of the family would be cool. Even if it was just something short like the above-mentioned fan fic. 

And if we really wanted to break that thang open, what if Dudley had a kid who wound up being a witch or wizard?? I mean... Dudley is related to the Potter side by blood via Lily, so it could definitely happen. I think a storyline where not only do we see the Harry/Dudley relationship develop, but we also see Dudley learning how to deal with being the parent of a wizard after the traumas and upbringing he experienced as a young boy. 

I'm not thinking a drawn out series or anything, just a fun little something something like the Christmas Burrow story. I don't know, maybe there isn't as much to it as I'm thinking, but I think there is some cool/fun potential there.",Dudley reunion?,1673375774

harrypotter,"It comes as no surprise that there is a prejudice between the Wizarding World, and also Muggles. But can you believe that such prejudice could be created by Hogwarts itself? 

Today we're going to look at this topic with another tongue and cheek humor. Lets do this! 

First off we should know that the Wizarding World exist in secret due to the persecutions faced by them during the Middle Ages, and this was when Muggles were feeling that religious fever so to speak. But the interesting thing is as much as Hogwarts was founded to teach the wizarding arts. Salazar Slytherin the founder of House Slytherin wanted Hogwarts to be a school of pure born practitioners to be allowed to practice magic. He even took Godric Gryffindor's tathered hat to create, you guessed it.....The Sorting Hat to of course place prospective students into such houses.

So early on Sly Salazar schemed a tradition that is still used today, even it those intentions are to put it in a better term, ""good"". While later of course Daddy Salazar would leave Hogwarts with intentions of his own and disappear. He would leave behind The Chamber of Secrets for which had a Basalisk to be unleashed to kill off Muggle raised and Half Bloods to make way for those dastardly pure bloods like them annoying Malfoys. 

""But Ferrum you say, Hogwarts was a sanctuary for the Wizards and Witches, it's not that bad.""

While this might be true, even evil is a road paved with good intentions. Keep in mind that while Dumbledore did in fact eventually go on to become headmaster at Hogwarts. Before his time there, as revealed in the Fantastic Beast stories, and Deathly Hallows, him and Grindelwald shared a deep connection to look for those dark relics so they too could become masters of death. While Dumbledore might have wanted nothing but good intentions, his blind devotion to Grindelwald would have him follow such a dark path, making an unbreakable oath, and eventually cause him to duel Grindelwald for the fated Elder Wand. So while he sought to redeem himself, the hunger for power was always there.

Finally lets talk about the deeper secret, The Founding Houses, while competition is all in good fun and humor? Much animosity has always flourished between the Houses. Especially Gryffindor and Slytherin. Examples can be found between James Potter and Snape over Lily. Then you also have Harry and Draco, though in time they do put their differences aside to face Voldemort and the Death Eaters too. The point is rivalry runs deep, and while competition is big for the House Cup. Much of that rivalry still can carry over after the years at Hogwarts. 

So it begs for one to wonder, does Hogwarts and the Houses help influence the Wizarding World? Or consume it from within?

I remember reenacting scenes with my sister when we were younger, and even reading the first 3 books as a kid too. Even though I didn't read all of the books, I can confidently say that Harry Potter has been a major part of my life and has always brought joy to me and my family.

Now that I'm older and me and my family have new lives and jobs obviously Harry Potter nights have become much less frequent. We still talk about them from time to time and still love the films but don't watch them nearly as much. 

Now on the rare occasion when I watch a movie, watch a clip of a scene on YouTube from one of the movies, or even listen to some of the scores, I get overwhelmed with emotion and nostalgia and start crying. I miss those moments of acting out scenes when I was younger and waiting for the new movies to come out, Harry Potter brought so much happiness to my life and still does to this day of course.

harrypotter,"In every book some form illegal magic happens around Harry which kind of predicts the main plot of the story.

First one - maybe a bit of a stretch but Hagrid illegally uses his wand to curse Dudley (he even tells Harry not to mention the incident to anyone) after which they go together to Gringotts where the Philosopher's Stone

Second one - Dobby comes to warn Harry about the Chamber of Secrets plot and tell him not to go to Hogwarts. Because Harry refuses, Dobby levitates the cake which prompts the Ministry to send him a warning letter

Third one - Harry runs away from the Dursleys after blowing his aunt and runs into Sirius/Padfoot

Fourth one - Harry almost gets attacked by Ministry employees because someone used his wand to cast the Dark Mark. We later learn that this was Crouch Jr who is working to resurrect Voldemort

Fifth one - Dementors in Little Whinging prompt Harry to cast a Patronus which sets up the conflict between Harry and the Ministry throughout the book

Sixth one - This one is a little bit reversed. Dumbledore comes to pick up Harry to find Slughorn and tells him to have his wand out ready in case but tells him not to worry because he (Harry) is with him (Dumbledore) and then takes Harry on side-along apparition. At the end Dumbledore tells Harry that he is not worried because he is with him and Harry illegally (as he does not yet have an apparition license) takes Dumbledore back to Hogsmeade via side-along apparition

Seventh one - Harry performs a bunch of spells during the battle of the seven Potters despite being underage, but the biggest one is Harry's wand attacking Voldemort, which prompts Voldemort to go on his quest for the Elder Wand

harrypotter,"Also known as Darth Wannabe.

More to the point, I'm referring to a certain minor character from Jim Butcher's famous book series, The Dresden Files, introduced in the short story ""Day Off"" in the compilation book ""Side Jobs"" as the 'antagonist' of what's one of the funniest moment in the entire franchise. And I wanted to know what you think of both this particular story and the series as a whole, since the subject matter is more or less the same and there are many references to Harry Potter in it.

Why, exactly, am I posting this? To elaborate: That series deals with wizards, monsters and magic on a large scale, taking inspiration from all sorts of mythologies and folk stories and even urban legends in very creative ways while still finding a way to be accurate to the source material. And among the hordes of characters inspired by creatures of legend and mythical characters, we have a **very** minor magic talent who Harry Dresden, the main character, derides as a poser and threatens with a revolver.

Especifically, 'Darth Wannabe' is a young ""magic practitioner"" leading his own troupe of Ringwraith reject to get back at Dresden, the eponymous protagonist (Who actually got his name from Houdini, not Potter), 'cause he undid a ""curse"" he cast (Something so minor it was unmade with just some reiki). He tries to be impressive and dramatic, but Dresden calls him and his friends a bunch of tryhards who wears a lot of black, drive a van with goat skulls and inverted crosses painted on the sides and, of course, wear Slytherin scarves and have Dark Marks tattooed on their arms; he even tells them that while he liked the movies, you don't see them going *that* far.

Then, when they challenge to a duel, he tells the Dim Lord and his flying monkeys that if they want to see magic then he can show them some magic. Not by actually casting a spell ('Cause that'd be overkill against those kids), but making the windows on their van disappear with some good ol' gunshots.

Now that you got some context, tell me: If you know of this series, what do you think of it in general and/or compared to this series? I'm sure that you ought to at least have an opinion on stuff like wizardry being nigh completely self-taught, magic having no language for its spellcasting and the presence of characters like The Fair Folk, vampires that are more like their myths portrayed than what modern media says they are, full-blown gods and demons and even belief systems integrated into magic as a whole.

And if you don't, what do you think of this story? And no, the author wasn't actually taking cheap shots at Harry Potter or anything of the sort (And neither am I, for that matter). It's just that, since wizards are more integrated to modern-day civilization compared to wizarding society (Which says a lot, since Dresden wizards can and do live for hundreds of years if given the chance), there HAD to be practitioners of some sort who thought that being a Death Eater would be a good idea. lol",The Dim Lord,1673330685
harrypotter,"I’m sure there’s a book reason for this, but why didn’t Dumbledore just leave Harry his wand (the elder wand) in his will? In Half Blood prince (the movie), after DD dies Harry is seen holding it and every time I see this scene I think “man, he would’ve saved himself so much trouble if he just took it then or snapped it right there.” 

I know that Harry didn’t snap it in the books and I know he didn’t know about the deathly hallows at this point but what I don’t understand is why Dumbledore just didn’t leave him the elder wand since he had already left him the other one ???",Dumbledore’s reasoning for not bequeathing the Elder wand to Harry ?,1673329814
harrypotter,"So I’ve just finished my once a year Harry Potter runthrough and I’ve just been wondering, is it necessary for me to watch the Fantastic Beasts movies as well? Do they expand on the story line, or are they their own seperate arc? I’ve never watched them when they came out in theatres because I didn’t know what they were and I’m very picky lmao. I have HBO and notice that they are on the service as well and want to know if they contribute or if they’re kinda just like their own “meh” arc of the Harry Potter series. TIA",Is watching Fantastic Beasts necessary?,1673327682
harrypotter,"(When I say unrealistic, of course, I mean within the logic of this fantasy world)

I was 18 I think when I read The Order of The Phoenix for the first time and one thing I always found 'odd' was how easily they enter the Ministry of Magic without no one seeing them!

I mean, in the muggle world we have from more basic security systems to more complex and hard to crack ones. 
Cameras, security guards, locks, alarms, etc. And for a public building like that, I expected good security.

Of course, they wouldn't be ""cameras"" there,  but not guard? no magic detectors or alarms? maybe I was expecting some equivalent to our security system somehow. 

Am I the only one who thought this was kinda odd? 

(Apologies for my mistakes, English is not my first language)","What was the ""one thing"" that was unrealistic to you while you were reading the books? For me was the gang infiltrating the Ministry of Magic without being caught",1673327564
harrypotter,"Quick note: this O.C. would be around at least 50-100 years after the events of Harry Potter. 

So I know most of the time, (it feels like) when people make an original character it's a student. but I had an idea for a teacher. This Teacher would teach Care of Magical Creatures and is a Half-Giant and Werewolf. But unlike every other Werewolf he is the first one who can fully control himself. Meaning if for some reason they needed to do a class at night during a full moon. He would be able to 100% no issue. (Just might get a tail wag when you answer correctly)

**Looks:** But Let's see if I can describe him well enough for you to picture them. I want to say he is about 9 feet in height, and very very muscular. I guess think of something between Hulk and Professor Hulk. Black hair in the style of a mohawk, reminiscent to a viking style. And of course he's just hairy all over thanks to the werewolf in him. Has lots of faded tattoos that look like they could be 1, very very detailed and it's just hard to tell now. OR they were just always a mess. A beard in between Hagrids and Dumbledore but tied into one braid. He has one Blue eye and one fully white eye with a nice scar going from the top of that eyebrow to his upper lip, (with a few other scars over his body) and his K9 teeth are always a bit bigger, even when not a werewolf. 

**Clothing**: For clothing he would wear just a harness on around his torso during the hot months were he would have bags attached to keep everything he needs. During the winter months he wears a normal shirt with the sleeves (most of the time) ripped off. 1-3 belts at all time depending on what he needs with him. For bottoms you can see him in some just normal pants, sometimes a fur-like kilt or one year a student got him a pair of super nice Jeans which he only wears if he is going to Hogsmead or on the weekends.

**Personality**: For being so ""rugged"" He takes great care of himself. making sure he never smells (students and teachers say he smells like firewood, a tiny bit of musk with a hint of vanilla. His Voice is deep and with a guttural growl to it. to the point he can scare people if he is not careful. He also knows signed language and teaches it to students who want to learn. to put his personality in a very blunt text. ""Looks like they can kill you, is a cinnamon roll. It's hard to get him upset but you can tell when that happens because he starts to stutter.

**Magical / Abilities:** Despite being a werewolf/half-gaint he is well versed in magic. Seemingly because of all the negative stereotypes put on him, He worked that much harder to overcome them and show people what he is capable of. He is even able to do wandless and wordless magic (though of course not nearly as strong) and can even block a few spells with himself alone. (Remember they needed to hit Hagrid with 4 stun spells before it did anything to him.) While in his werewolf form he is of course much stronger and faster but can't use magic. 

**Weaknesses:** While he works very hard to make sure he comes off nice and approachable some days it can be harder then others. Due to his size and voice he can be scary. to the point normally 1st years avoid him at all costs until a older student or teacher comes in and changes that. As stated before when he gets upset he starts to stutter, and goes until he looses his temper (which is extremely rare) and when that happens he turns into a crying mess. Also While is able to control himself, he knows at one point his werewolf instincts might be to much and that scares him. He is also known to be a bit to confident. Once having to be talked out of being hit with a killing curse because as he put it ""My pecs are so big it would bounce right off"" But that only happens after a few hours of drinking.

**Fun Facts**  
1. He ""owns"" 3 wands. His own and his Mothers, and his grandfathers.  
2. All Wands are inside one wand that is more like a staff to normal people. He rarely uses it however. More or less using ""wandless magic""  
3. His own ""personal"" wand was a 20 inch blackthorn with a dragon heartstring core.  
4. He was in  Gryffindor, but almost was put in Hufflepuff. The shorting hat took a bit trying to choose  
5. He was in the top 10 of his class  
6. Tried to play quidditch but brooms really cant hold that much weight  
7.  Hagrid is a hero to him  
8. He loves to apperate  
9. He wants to try and master fiendfyre but is to nervous to do so.  
10. Before coming teacher he was an Auror.  
11. One time while eating breakfast a bad wizard hit him with a curico curse. He finished his breakfast then calmly walked over to the gun before punching him out cold. Thats one of his more favorite rumors.  
12. During the summer months he takes a bath in the lake. Just be careful going out around midnight.  
13. He lives pretty much in the same spot where Hagrid lived. However his hut is bigger and has more of a ""castle light house"" feel to it.  
14. He is pansexual and has been known to be the ""handsome teacher"" by students and teachers. However if you say anything he turns beat red.  
15. He tries to help in the kitchen, but due to his size really can't and mostly annoys the house elves.  
17.  He swears... a lot  
18. He has a sister (fully human wizard) who works in the M.O.M. Her son goes to Hogwarts.  
19. In between Hogwarts and being an Auror he worked in a more ""adult"" field  
20. He is a candidates to one day become headmaster   
21. He LOVES LOVES LOVES to sing. However he sounds worse then mermaids out of the water.

harrypotter,"Hermione most likely felt insecure about herself in her own way, although not showing it. She most likely felt she was not attractive enough, not funny enough and simply not Ron's tempo. This might be one reason why she was so mad at Fleur all the time. She scowled when she kissed Ron, and was thoroughly foul to Fleur when she stayed at the Burrow. Because Fleur was a born beauty to male eyes from her genes alone. Having been mocked look-wise before, she probably felt that Ron would never choose her. And the fact that she was inherently nerdy while Ron obviously seemed to prefer hanging with more laid-back, outwardly funny and joking styled kids more (not that he didn't like Hermione being around him) probably didn't help.

As for Ron, it's obvious why he was insecure. Krum and Potter. Both of them famous throughout countries. One for being an amazing Quidditch player. One for hoodwinking the dark lord almost every year since he attended Hogwarts, and beating him as a boy. Both were extremely popular and liked by girls (Harry was only really liked after he did something cool, like prove he was right which in the eyes of girls, made him some masculine tough god who was strong and resilient). And, as Hermione's other best friend, both were on equal terms with Hermione, so he wouldn't really have a head start on her if it became a race to see who could charm her.

So in the end, both were just so blinded by the negative mindset of ""oh, they're gonna want someone else"" that they couldn't realize that the ""competition"" they had wasn't even real. Krum was more of a friend/experimental relationship than a long-term partner. Harry showed no signs of romantic affection for Hermione and likewise. And Fleur was more of eye-candy to Ron than someone he'd actually date in the future. Both actually liked each other, but couldn't even see it.",I thoroughly enjoyed how Ron and Hermione always liked each other but were too insecure and jealous to see it,1673324332

harrypotter,"Currently rereading the books after having only read them when I was very young, and something has become glaringly obvious; Harry Potter is a stupid child who is too proud for his own good. 

It’s obvious that it’s because he is young and stupid, thinking he always knows right because that’s what teenagers do. But because the movies follow an actor who ages 2-3 years between each movie that only has a 1 year gap, it feels like Harry is more mature in the 4th movie onwards. Radcliffe also acts older in his delivery and I can’t help but feel like they probably wrote the movies that way to make him sound more his own age. 

It’s not until you read the book when you realize that Harry Potter is painfully young. So young that I’ve been yelling in my head about things that happen in the 4th and 5th books simply because if he just wasn’t such a proud little brat, things would be so much easier for everyone. He could tell the truth, speak, and ask questions, but having watched the movies for so long, I’ve forgotten how young he is and how undeveloped that makes his brain. Hermione acts like the only sane person in a group of idiots, being the only voice of reason for a grown up reader which is a nice way to grasp some sense of sanity when I’m reading a young teen make bafflingly accurate decisions for someone his age.","It’s very easy to forget how young Harry is supposed to be in the movies, but NOT in the books",1673318875

harrypotter,"I have been reading the HP novels to my daughter, and we've made it to The Deathly Hallows. I weep uncontrollably every time I read about Dobby's death.

harrypotter,"As many of you know, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child recently made its return to major theatre areas around the world. This new version of the play was only one part as opposed to two, cut around 1.5 hours worth of story, and features a new love story. I never saw the original version of the play, but I did read the script... and like a lot of people, I truly hated most of what I read. The characterizations of everyone were terrible, the constant usage of nostalgia felt off-putting, and the idea that Cedric Diggory was an important-enough character to warrant the entire ""eighth story"" in the HP being about him was just so weird. I didn't have any plans to see this on the stage and thought that was the end.

But this month, a family member of mine, who's a big fan of Harry Potter, got tickets to see this new version of the story. I was invited to watch it as well, so I attended the show in Toronto. I said to myself, even though I didn't like the script, I wanted to keep an open mind about what I was about to watch. Even with my problems with the story, I was intrigued by how the crew would pull off the production/magic stuff. 

I sat in my seat, the lights went down, and for 3 hours and 20 minutes, I was... incredibly disappointed. This story just does not work. In every sense of it, this story falters completely. The pacing is terrible, the dialogue is atrocious, Harry Potter is an absolutely terrible father despite nothing in the previous stories pointing to this becoming a possibility, most female characters are shafted completely then reappear randomly (Ginny, Rose, and even Hermoine), Ron gets nothing to do, Delphi is without-a-doubt the worst villain in the franchise, and the usage of Voldemort, Snape, and Cedric had my rolling my eyes. Somehow, the show felt jarringly fast and incredibly slow at the same time. In order to save time from the previous version, the first 20 minutes feel like an F1 race on steroids before coming to a screeching halt to actually set up the story, which again, is so boring and pretty confusing to keep up with. 

The saving grace of this new version is Albus and Scorpius' love story, which is a new addition. Despite not getting nearly enough time to actually explore their relationship, they were just adorable together, but nothing more. Honestly, if you do without all the bigger Harry Potter stuff, this story between the two young men would be a fairly standard, and enjoyable rom-com. But no, we have to get a story about Harry constantly going after Albus and Albus acting like the worst teenager to ever exist. 

I don't know if it's Jack Thorne, Rowling, or whoever else was involved in the writing of both versions of this story, but it's just awful. This should've probably been a movie to begin with, as then they could at least pull this thing off visually, but even then, after reading the script, I'd say kill it with fire. 

The actual production of the play was solid, with the crew using pretty cool optical illusions and practical effects to pull off the magic of the universe. But after a while, you'll find yourself wondering about how something would've and could've looked better if this was just a movie or TV show. There are just certain things in the HP universe that don't work on stage... mainly, WIZARD SPELLS. 

I'm all for supporting stage productions, but this one is just bad. I guess it's a saving grace that I saw the 3-hour version instead of the 5... because if I almost fell asleep during the Toronto production, who knows what would've happened in the London production. 

And just one more thing... none of this has anything to do with the cast. If any of you come across this post, know that none of you are the problem with this show and you all did a fine job. The writing is not nearly up to par with your acting skills.",I recently watched the revised version of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child and I have a lot of thoughts...,1673309785
harrypotter,"Just curious really. If anything I would of liked to seen a bit more of the other characters time to shine. Like maybe a chapter where we go from Neville to Ginny to someone else just to see them fight and stuff.

as for the movie. I wish after Harry and Voldemort fought, and they landed back into the courtyard Harry still did the speech telling Voldemort why he was always going to loose. But still keep the fight in itself. Would of been a bit dumb to watch Harry be under his cloak while watching everyone fighting for their lives.

harrypotter,"Rumours about a reboot don't really surprise me every major franchise gets remade or rebooted sooner or later and I'm actually surprised it took this long. My main worries about them rebooting the series is firstly if they decide to make new movies I feel not enough time has passed and the 8 movies we got were good solid adaptations and I think new movies won't be as good and will receive the same complaints people have for the other movies about stuff that gets left out.

Now as many people have said a tv series would be the perfect way to go about it and be able to be more faithful to the books. My biggest worry however is will the people who work on a potential series be passionate about making a faithful adaptation of these stories because I could totally see them wanting to put their own stamp on the series and make a lot of unnecessary changes to make it completely different from the books and movies. Also given Warner Bros handling of major franchises in recent years it leaves me less than confident about how they would go about any sort of reboot.

harrypotter,"I was recently thinking about how boring it was that all of the major dark wizards and villains were just obsessed with hating and subjugating Muggles. Then, I remembered a villain from a really terrible show, and I had an idea. The next major antagonist should be a wizard who hates magic, either because it's unfair to Muggles, or because it's unnatural or something. Perhaps they could be a Muggleborn, or maybe they could even masquerade as a Muggle, even though they're not. Essentially, they want to use magic to destroy magic. In the end, they could even reveal that they didn't believe in their own cause and were only doing it for personal gain (this might be too cliche).

So, the story goes like this - I’m a huge fan of the movies - watching almost every year, but have read the books only once years ago, and in my native language.

Obviously, I’d want the original UK version, but there just aren’t nice designs. I like the US version of the cardboard box set, (Juniper one with house designs or the old Levine one, both are cool dust jacket designs but I detest the Juniper print), but I don’t want the US print.

Good adaptation is rare, especially if it's more than one movie, and especially if the source material is primarily made for children or teenager. You can name a hundred bad adaptation, but the one as unanimously loved by their fandom as hp are few and far between. One, if not several, of all those things that went right the first time is bound to go wrong this time (my bet is on Rowling view on her work and her importance in it having greatly changed since the release of the first movie).

harrypotter,"Magical evolution theory suggests that given what we know about the magical world, it is likely if not inevitable that the magical world will engulf the muggle world. The main points I will use to prove this will be population, politics and human nature because at the end of the day wizards are human too.


To start with we know that the population of witches and wizards is low during the events of the books. After dealing with the magical wars, two by voldemort and one grindlewald, there is likely to be a baby boom just like with our world after world war 2. Because of the acceptance of muggle born witch and wizards into wizarding society the population will soon ovwrtake muggles. We don't know the rates at which these people are born but given how many appear in the books I think it is fair to say the numbers are significant and only going to rise. 

An argument against this is the birth of squibs or non magical people born to magical family's. However I would argue that there is clear evidence that these people are likely to stay in the wizarding world. Filch is evidence that squibs are not kicked out of society, given how prejudiced the wizarding community is shown to be I'm sure that most squibs are treated as second class citizens, but I would say they are still more likely to stay in the wizarding world this I'd because they are not likely to leave to the almost alien muggle world. Arthur Weasley who is meant to work in the field of muggles is fascinated by simply things like the underground escalator and a rubber duck. The average wizard is going to be terrified at the idea of joining the muggle world. I would also say that life for squibs in the wizarding world is likely to get better again proved by Flitch working at one of the most prestigious wizarding school in the world. We are also shown that the younger generations are much more progressive when it comes to non magical people showing again that life will improve as the years pass. Plus there is the improvement to life that comes with living inside a magical world even without magic, bewitched items to make life easier would surely make even people without magic want to stay. 

Another point against my theory is that the magical world is just more dangerous, so the numbers of population will not grow. Jobs like inventing magic potions and caring for dangerous magical creatures and plants. But to this I would say these jobs are more likely to be few and far between rather than the norm. The magical world must have stores, restaurants and business of all kinds. Just like in the muggle world most jobs are likely to be safe. Even with the dangous jobs it is clear that health care in the wizarding world is much better than the muggle with people living much longer and being healed from most injuries and illnesses. 

Now if you accept my point that the population will rise through the decades then I believe this would bring in many changes for the wizarding world namely lack of jobs. With magic the jobsof ten people can be done with one spell and with better health care and easy work, just casing spells the age and amount of people retiring is like to go down substantially. This will make more witches and wizards poorer and dangling on the poverty line. Also as the population grows space will come at a premium. We have seen that magic can do strange things with space (tent at quidditch world cup) but even with this there is only so much space and so much money to buy the available space to go around. This will push poor and poorer witches and wizards closer and closer to the muggle world with poor people almost rubbing shoulders with muggles. 

I  belive this will all come to a head with poor witch's and wizards being becoming poorer and angrier and angrier. I belive it wouldn't take much, a charismatic smooth talking dark witch or wizard, to use this unrest. They could to work their way up the political system to be voted minister of magic. They could then use this position with the backing of the people to start a war with the muggle world for space and control of the planet. This dark Lord would be different than any that came before as unlike Voldemort this person would have the backing of a country and more legitimacy. 

I know what your thinking, earlier I argued that the wizarding world is getting more progressive now I'm say there is going to be a war with them. The difference is I didn't say which ministry was going to war. It is clear that there are a great many. There is the British one in the main books then there is an American ministry, who is to say there is not a great many ministries just like in the muggle world, all with different ideas and ideals of how the world should work just like in this world. But it just takes one of them to be corrupted by a dark wizard or by bad politics for a war to start. 

In closing I belive this is inevitable as the population grows and poor people are squeezed more and more, hiding will seem almost pointless, the liklihood goes up and up as population rises. We know there are many dark wizards who could easily use this tension to rise up and exercise power, the angrier the people are the easier it will be to turn the anger on to an ""other"" in this case muggles. But there will still be progressive wizards and a progressive ministry who will fight to save muggles but this will most likely, with the massive number of wizards, lead to the unveiling of the wizarding world. The outcome of the war in my mind is irrelevant, as soon as it starts the wizarding world is over and it is just the world with whole new challenges of co habition.

I belive the only thing that could stop this outcome are more magical wars, if the wizarding world can't come together and get along long enough for their numbers to grow they can't outnumber muggles. If the magical community doesn't progress as is expected and doesn't become more welcoming to non magical people like squibs and muggleborns and pushes them out of the magical world and into the muggle one then the overpopulation won't happen as quickly or at all.

harrypotter,"Hot off the latest Xmas rewatch, I've been on a Potter bender.

One thing that stood out to me in this rewatch was Harry's emotional evolution and how expertly it's handled. I particularly love Harry's choices in Prisoner of Azkaban. See, a complaint about Harry Potter is that if he would just tell the adults AKA Dumbledore what's going on, a lot of problems would be solved. However, Book 3 really presents a plausible reason for Harry to not be able to share what he knows with Dumbledore, as Sirius is at first a personal vendetta Harry feels some shame for, and later as a fugitive, Harry can't fully expose Sirius.

Then, by the time Harry realizes he really just needs to tell Dumbledore what's up, the headmaster becomes a fugitive. Then, he dies.

So this question of ""Just tell the adults what you know"" becomes complicated very very quickly.

Now let's consider why Harry is the ""Boy who lived"". As he says, even up until Order of the Phoenix, his phenomenal 3/3 record against Voldemort is due to luck, help and unknown factors. He of all people, worthy because of confronting fear and danger courageously, nevertheless admits that his success is not in any way a product of his own skill or power.

Harry lived because of Lily's old magic spell. That was broken by Voldemort's deep spell. Azkaban, the only book where Harry did not confront Voldemort, features a telling prophecy, and the events surrounding Pettigrew. I suspect there is a link between the prophecy and the intention of Voldemort. In the magical world, powerful wizards shape events which become spells. These are mirrored by prophecies which become more true as the spells grow in power. Understand?

In the book ""Johnathan Strange and Mr. Norrell"" there are two gentlemen of England, who many years after the disappearance of magic, are somehow able to do it again. In the end, a strange and seemingly minor encounter with a malicious fey folk becomes a massive set of spells that changes England. It turns out this seemingly random, malicious fey might have been connected to the great master of English magic since Merlin, the Raven King. The random events circumscribing the lives of Johnathan Strange and Mr. Norrell turn out to be products of a weird and wonderfully planned spell by the Raven King to trick and defeat this powerful and evil fairy. The fairy is totally tricked, almost up to the level in which Eru Iluvatar tricks and defeats Sauron by using the curse of his own magic to - through Gollum by way of the kindness of Frodo - curse the Ring to meet its own demise.

I am completely certain, through Deathly Hallows, that Dumbledore used the Deathly Hallows - a very vague, mysterious, and tangentially but mysteriously powerful magic - to complete a spell he had been casting for many years. Harry Potter was merely a lucky ingredient of the spell to defeat Voldemort. Yes, Voldemort was defeated because of a masterful, god-tier advanced spell of Dumbledore in which Harry was a mere ingredient.

Thus, in this interpretation of advanced magic where manipulating people and events and incorporating varieties of magic produces strong and unimpeachable results, Slytherin House was made part of Hogwarts.

We easily forget the emblem of Ravenclaw isn't - lol - a raven. It's an Eagle. This is an imperial emblem. The lion is regal. The badger is defiant. The snake is something else.

Hogwarts is not merely a school. It is a spell cast upon English magic. It is as profound as the spell of the Raven King. It affects all English magic, and resonates through the wider world due to England's connection to old magic.

It's not that Slytherin is tolerated. Slytherin is part of the spell. The Basilisk was the spell's concession to Salazar. Yes, of course Slytherin is evil. But Hogwarts is a spell meant to drive a line between the muggle and magical worlds. To protect BOTH of them, and allow wizards to deal with the arcane and dangerous elements of the magical universe (goblins, beasts, elves, etc.)

Thus we must not think of Slytherin as evil. Instead. We must become part of the spell, the legacy of Merlin. We must be grateful that magic and muggle are regulated and put in order, for the benefit of both.

The topic of what muggles might do to the magical world is fascinating. It invokes the concept of ""before"" old magic. Of a magic that muggles can invoke, the grand and greater spells. Magic can't make food or gold. The mundane and profane can. Science is like a sweeping uber-magic. It's universal common sense. Plato's forms, shared by all to no one's benefit unless they are universally obeyed. Where the wizard can refuse to obey, the muggle must. But, the muggle, in obeying, might gain a greater power.

I have never been a fan of David Yates. He ruined OotP for me by cutting out a lot of the scenes that really showcased Harry's growth as a character. I've always thought that the odd-numbered installments in HP (with the exception of Deathly Hallows) were more about character development and how everything was affecting him, while the even-numbered installments were more story-driven. Yet Yates cut most of those scenes out, and pulled a lot of punches (i.e. muting Harry's scream when Sirius falls through the veil and not having him lash out at Dumbledore the way he did in the book). And where the hell was the scene where it was revealed that Umbridge (who was nowhere near as sadistic as she was in the book) ordered the dementor attack on Harry? The only thing I was impressed by was his adapting the longest book in the series into the shortest film, but I think they could have made an alternate cut of the film with some of the scenes that were left on the cutting room floor being added and some of the existing scenes being cut which would be roughly the same length.

He got better with the subsequent films (possibly due to Steve Kloves returning as screenwriter) but they still weren't as good IMO as the first four films. I know that politics play a significant part in the story, but the tone of Yates's later films is a little too political IMO. Combining the politics with the way in which most of the characters are dressed in the later films hardly makes it seem like a fantasy film about wizards at all.

I don't agree with the stuff that JKR has said in recent years, but I think she's a good writer, and I think Steve Kloves is a good screenwriter. But David Yates is not a good director for the Wizarding World franchise because he doesn't know which scenes are essential to the story and which ones can be cut or re-worked. Also, Yates went from directing low-budget, made-for-TV movies to one of the largest franchises of all time without any stepping stones in between. Chris Columbus had ""Home Alone"", Alfonso had ""A Little Princess"", Mike Newell had ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" as well as an extensive resume dating back to the 1960s (I don't think his ""Bollywood"" direction style would have worked for most of the films but it worked for GoF), and Yates? The previous film he directed before OotP was ""The Girl in the Cafe"", and all of his films were either TV movies or shorts. Outside of the UK he was practically unknown. So he was an odd choice of director IMO.

I still think they have a shot at steering the FB franchise in the right direction but they need to get the right person for the job.","What if the reason why the FB series failed isn't because of JKR and the writers, but because of David Yates?",1673215994

harrypotter,"I decided to read through the HP books for the first time in many years, taking notes about various things as I did so to keep track of everything.

One of those things is the locations of various places within Hogwarts and, more specifically to this post, the entrance to the Gryffindor common room. I'd gotten the majority of the way through the first book believing that the entrance to the Gryffindor Tower was through a hole behind the portrait of the Fat Lady at the end of a corridor on the second floor.

My reason for thinking it's on the second floor is from a few pieces of evidence:

* When Percy first leads them to the common room from the Sorting Ceremony's feast, they climb multiple staircases - that puts it on a floor higher than floor 1 (i.e. at least floor 2).
* When going back to the common room after defeating the troll in the girls' toilet (which I believe is on the ground floor), Ron and Harry don't talk until they've climbed two floors up. Then a brief conversation is described and they reach the common room. From this quote, it's possible for the entrance to be more than two floors up, but I think it's implied to be on the second floor, and it's definitely not lower than the second floor.
* When going to the trophy room to duel Malfoy, they went up a staircase to the third floor. Now, even if there were more than just this one staircase (which isn't implied), this means that it's definitely below floor 3.

If it's at least as high as the second floor and lower than the third floor, it must be on the second floor - there's no other option.

Nothing contradicted this throughout the book, so I held fast to my belief. Until they sneak out at night to the forbidden third-floor corridor to stop ""Snape"" from stealing the Philosopher's stone. In this instance, they go up two sets of stairs - the first of which Mrs Norris is skulking at the top of and they climb around her, the second of which, which is mentioned as ""the staircase up to the third floor"", Peeves is floating halfway up.

I was a bit confused by the contradiction to what I thought was the truth, so I googled for the location of the Gryffindor common room. Imagine my surprise when all the sites say it's on the seventh floor! 

I looked at what the source for that is, and the wiki says ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game)."" Are the video games really the accepted source of canon over the books? Or is this backed up elsewhere in later books?

I'm going to note down the contradiction I found as a potential plot hole or potential for a strange Hogwarts layout (e.g. the first corridor led to a balcony halfway up the second floor and the second corridor led the rest of the way up to the third floor) and keep making notes as I read to try and figure it out. But the thing with the seventh floor is just crazy imo, since there are at least two quotes showing them going upwards from the common room to the third floor.

harrypotter,"I’ve been rewatching the Harry Potter films recently and beside the fact I think there are a lot of issues with how jk wrote and told the story of character’s one who I always will think is unfairly hard done by and wasted is Draco.

Jk Rowling should of written a book showing the life of Draco and his mother, by how their relationship and the lestrange family seem I’d think that Narcissus marriage to Lucius was arranged and abusive and that part of Dracos horrible attitude came from his home life and how his father was horrible to him and his mother. 
Rowling should of written a book showing a pov of Dracos home life and maybe even including how his mother and father met. Rowling then should of showed different areas of Draco’s life leading up to half blood Prince which then goes into Dracos battle with wanting to be good but being in a situation where he’s forced to be bad.

A book like this could of been really interesting and given Dracos character the depth it really needed.
However all in all I hate Dracos ending anyway I think a much better ending would be if at the end of half blood Prince he chose not to kill Dumbledoor by his own choice not Snape stopping him and then joined the order leading him to help out in deathly hallows and maybe once again in his own book showing the effects of him being a Slytherin who turned good!",Jk Rowling should of made a separate Draco Malfoy book showing his pov.,1673215274

An example of this is how the trio end up at the shrieking shack. They didn't follow clues to catch Sirius Black like they would have in the previous writing style, In fact they only end up in the shrieking shack because Hermiones cat chased Scabbers/Peter to the womping willow.

harrypotter,"... and boy did it raise a lot of questions. However, I'll just post 2 here:

1] Do wizards have no due process at all? Percival Graves just gets to make an instant, one-man decision on the death penalty, and everyone is down with it? Like, it must happen a lot since a) the American ministry has its own built-in execution chamber, and b) everyone - including Tina's coworkers - is just cool with putting her down immediately. 

Moreover, do these people not consider themselves Americans *even slightly?* They're surrounded by normal humans whose entire country is built around a notion of established and inalienable human rights. But their little sect has no rights at all? They're SO removed from muggles that their system is tantamount to a rule-by-fiat dictatorship?

2] Why haven't wizards taken over the world? In the books, magic seemed, if not quite trivial, then at least relatively on-par with the power of one-man technology. This is to say that a single wizard couldn't utter a few words and set off the equivalent of a nuclear bomb. Even when Voldemort and Co. blew up a bridge, that appeared to be a) an extremely impressive feat, and b) a group effort by the Death Eaters.

In Magical Beasts, not only are single wizards essentially wordlessly shattering buildings, but it's pretty clear that average American Aurors are just amble to effortlessly reassemble said destruction in seconds. 

Moreover, we know from the books that even a lot of wizards who AREN'T Death Eaters consider themselves to be superior to the rest of humanity. So you have this subset of elitist super-beings, many of whom think they've transcended humanity, and... Grindlewald and Voldemort are just wildly ""out there"" in aiming for some form of world conquest/subjugation? Wha??",Saw Fantastic Beasts for the first time last night...,1673198915

harrypotter,"Hottake: The way most people understand the house system is wrong. The way most people seem to think it works is like star signs, where you get a full batch of personality traits that you need to adhere to, most of them being subject to fairly substantial change in a normal human ages 11 to 17. 
 Due to this, a lot of people decry the house system as impractical, and bad, something that I am inclined to agree with 
HOWEVER, I don’t think that this is how it was intended, at least not by the founders of Hogwarts. 
 In the legend of the Secret Chamber, McGonnagal tells us about the founding of Hogwarts. She says that the founders couldn’t agree on which students to teach, so they all taught their own houses. Slytherin wanted to teach purebloods, so to get into Slytherin you needed to be a pureblood. To get into Ravenclaw you needed to hold knowledge as the highest virtue, to get into Gryffindor you needed to be exceptionally brave, and Hufflepuff took the rest. 
 This interpretation is way more practical from the viewpoint of the founders, as it solves their original problem.
The different personality traits that are assigned to the houses, I think are prejudices that evolved later: Samrt people are awkward eggheads, Brave people reckless jocks, etc. Being a stereotype for your house was never an intended requirement to get in. 
 Now I realise, that the legend is the only confirmation we have of this interpretation, but I at least think that this is the version that makes the most sense.","The house system has been completely misunderstood, and retconned!",1673188675

harrypotter,"I’m not arguing with whether it was right or wrong that Harry got placed second for trying to rescue all the hostages, but why did any of the judges other than Dumbledore and Bagman agree?

Karkaroff hates Harry and gave him an undeserved 4 in the first task. 
Madame Maxine is maybe a fairer judge but she also doesn’t want Harry to win, since he was tied first, especially since Fleur came last. 

Percy is the ultimate pedantic rule follower and proves again and again that (at this stage) he cares more about what seems proper than the “right” decision. Yes, he’s worried about Ron, but they’re all safe in the end.

harrypotter,"Hi everyone!

Maybe it's the Ravenclaw in me, but I would absolutely love to do some data analysis to look for correlations and relationships between people's houses, wand types, patronuses, and other information.

If you'd like to participate, please comment your wizarding world information (house, wand, and patronus), as well as any other information you'd like to (but you dont have to) include, like your gender identity, Myers-Briggs type, where you're from (state or country), etc.

For example, here's mine:
- House: Ravenclaw
- Wand: Hawthorn, Phoenix Feather, 11 3/4 inches, unyielding
- Patronus: Siberian Cat
- Gender Identity: Female
- Myers-Briggs Type: ISFJ
- Where I'm From: Wisconsin, USA

The only thing I ask is that you only comment your official wizarding world results, not which house/wand/patronus you'd like to have. And please don't comment your results if you knowingly answered dishonestly to get the result you wanted, just because I want to keep the data as accurate as possible.

I'll need quite a few people to comment in order to get a large enough sample size, so even if you dont want to participate, if you could at least upvote this thread so more people will see it, I'd appreciate it.

Thank you!!

P.S. I'll definitely be posting an update with the results if i end up getting enough responses to have a big enough sample size to do an analysis.","Please comment your house, wand, and patronus so I can do a little data analysis",1673107536

harrypotter,"Specifically, about the prophecy. I would've written about it in my previous thread about it (see here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/sxz2pn/in\_harry\_potter\_do\_the\_prophecies\_all\_come\_true/](https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/sxz2pn/in_harry_potter_do_the_prophecies_all_come_true/)) but it was locked, so I'm making a new one. 

The prophecy was to be fulfilled, of that I'm almost certain for two reasons: 

1) Dumbledore lied to him about the fact that he must die in order to destroy the last horcrux inside of him, something it was certainly needed to fulfill the prophecy. Dumbledore in ""Half-Blood prince"" tries to convince Harry of the importance of acting of his own free will, but this must be surely because, being a very smart man, he knew Harry would've acted against it at the last moment, and reassuring him he must choose himself ensures him the prophecy, not the headmaster, will correct Harry's path. Don't forget that Dumbledore's plan was for Harry to fight Voldemort AFTER destroying all the horcruxes, while we all know the snake was still alive at the time. 

2) For me, at the last duel of Harry v Voldemort, the clue that the prophecy was in action was the fact the Elder Wand belonged to Harry. In the hands of Voldemort, it wouldn't have worked. Especially because Harry didn't intend to kill Voldemort. Instead, the Avada Kedavra made by Voldemort rebounded, but it all acted automatically, after the prophecy set things in motion. Chance wasn't there at that duel.

harrypotter,"I saw the series of Harry Potter, and the movies in FB, question is, Grindelwald holding the wand. I didn’t see anything “strong” with the wand. Voldemort held it and said the wand gave strong power because he had the knowledge to do so, so far Grindelwald hasn’t impressed me with the “strongest wand”. He fought Dumbledore and judging from the film, Dumbledore didn’t have problems facing someone holding the wand.  Dumbledore fought Voldemort using the wand at the ministry and impression’s are, what the difference with a wand that everyone’s using? The only thing I noticed about it was that when Voldemort used the wand to break the protection the wand went to pieces meaning that a regular wand couldn’t afford to do his bidding.

As for Dumbledore, this is even dumber. Yeah, I know there's a magical contract (and it makes NO sense how a magical object that's meant to choose 17+ year olds for a inter-school contest would create a magical contract that's above Dumbledore's magical powers to destroy/change it), but the contract never stopped Harry from cheating, or anyone else from cheating, at that. And obviously, playing fair in a competition that's reward is fame and 1000 galleons to the winner, is nothing compared to the grand plan of stopping the greatest Dark Wizard who seeks to put the world under his foot.

So why, may I ask, did Dumbledore not take every measure necessary to ensure Harry's safety. The kid could've died several times over (he almost got slammed by a Horntail's tail in the movie and got slashed in the arm in the books). If I was Dumbledore, I'd be taking no risks and be secretly giving him info from the sidelines. Heck, I'd even manipulate the competition while it unfolds to ensure his safety (come on, he's the greatest Wizard to live, there's no way that he'd be unable to hoodwink some Ministry officials and a bunch of teenagers to help Harry cheat). As for Snape, you'd think he'd convey some handy tips to someone else who'd convey it then, to Harry. He's been anonymously watching Harry from the sidelines and it's stupid how he'd be willing to take such a gamble on Lily's sake on something so dangerous.

harrypotter,"The series ends with the words “All was well”. But how can it be that all was well if nothing essentially changed after the defeat of Voldemort? 

The wizarding world is extremely racist towards every other sentient magical race (goblins, elves, merpeople, centaurs, giants, etc). Such a world allowed the Ministry of Magic to be formed, which constantly abuses its power and benefits from said racism (mainly via goblins and elves), while preventing all other races from using wands and thus maintaining their hegemony. It is out of that system that somebody like Voldemort rose to power and if you think about it nothing essentially changed after he was defeated. There were no systemic changes in their world that could prevent something like that happening again. And Voldemort really isn’t that much worse from the majority of other wizards, he is just more extreme and his racism extends to muggles and muggle-borns as well. 

After Rowling introduced elements to the world such as slavery or the goblin rebellions (in which the goblins had a violent uprising protesting against their mistreatment by wizards), defeating Voldemort simply isn’t a satisfying enough ending. 

Yet, none of the characters seem to care that the world is so broken. You would expect Harry to be a bit more empathetic considering he grew up in the muggle world and should thus not be desensitized but shocked at the inequality of this new world, yet he doesn’t care at all. When he finds out that Slughorn has been testing poisons on house elves his first thought it how annoyed Hermione would be. And the entire resolution to the slavery plot line is that elves enjoy being slaves. What the hell?

Rowling seems to think that just because Harry and Hermione now work for the ministry that everything is fine, when that would be impossible because the same broken systems still exist.",Why doesn’t a single character in the books care that the wizarding world is so broken and racist?,1673059585

harrypotter,"This is completely inspired by /u/[SaraSmile416] and her retelling of the Harry Potter series written from Hermione’s perspective. I am currently reading her version of Prisoner of Azkaban (which is so far, the most gripping fanfic I have ever read) and it got me thinking: what if there was an entry for each book in the series featuring a different character? I thought it might be fun to outline some of my ideas and which story elements could be included in each book. Enjoy!

Book 1: 
Ron Weasley and the Black Knight
-the troll attack
-the Mirror of Erised
-sneaking off to Hagrid’s and Norbert
-the third floor corridor
-his giant chess game 

Book 2:
Ginny Weasley and the Secret Diary
-the diary, of course
-being possessed
-encounter with the Malfoy’s
-navigating her first year classes with students in her house whom we’ve never met (such as a young Luna Lovegood?)
-her heavy crush on Harry Potter
-encounters Moaning Myrtle
-the Chamber of Secrets

Book 3:
Hermione Granger and the Time Turner
This one has already been done justice, albeit with the title, “Hermione Granger and the Prisoner of Azkaban” thanks to SaraSmile416. Her primary storyline goes into great detail on the time turner and the emotional stress it puts on Hermione as she tries to keep everything in order, as well as the toll it takes on her friendships with Harry and Ron, Ginny, and a few others (I won’t spoil too much). Seriously, read it if you like the concept!

Book 4:
Fred and George Weasley and the Faux Galleons (Idk about that title, help me!)
-Ludo Bagman storyline
-Quidditch World Cup and the death eater attack
-attempt on the Goblet of Fire
-experimenting with their joke toys and candies
-starting their Wizard Wheezes business
-witnessing/betting on the tournament
-obtaining the galleons from Harry

Book 5:
Luna Lovegood and the Veil of Mysteries
-meeting Harry Potter
-friendship with Ginny and Neville
-being an outsider in the Ravenclaw house
-the Quibbler
-joining Dumbledore’s Army
-producing a patronus
-thestrals
-adventures in the department of mysteries

Book 6:
Draco Malfoy and the Vanishing Cabinet
-father going to prison
-his task given by Voldemort
-exploring his relationship with Narcissa
-petrifying Harry on the Hogwarts Express
-attempts on Dumbledore’s life (such the necklace and the wine bottle)
-sneaking into Slughorns party
-relationship with Snape
-inner turmoil with realizing he is not the person he thought he was
-Sectumsempra curse
-Mending the cabinet

Book 7:
Neville Longbottom and the Sword of Gryffindor
-Bill and Fleur’s wedding
-going to Hogwarts under Snape as headmaster
-dealing with the Carrows
-growing as a leader and person
-friendships with Ginny and Luna
-bringing Dumbledore’s Army back
-alliance with Aberforth Dumbledore
-Luna being taken by Death eaters
-the battle of Hogwarts
-pulling the sword out of the hat

Harry’s first prediction is that he will have a risk of getting burnt, the first task involved dragons. Ron’s prediction was that he would lose something most cherished, the second task ended up, having Ron kidnapped as as Harry’s most prized possession by the influence of mercury, Mercury = merpeople. The third prediction involved Harry getting betrayed by someone he thought as a friend,this could represent two things, Viktor Krum’s betrayal in the maze, or more importantly, Mad Eye Moody’s “betrayal” in disguise by Barty Crouch Junior. Harry thought of Moody as a mentor and helper by the end. The final prediction before they continued their homework, Harry says that he will come out worse in a fight at the end.

So my mind totally gave birth on its own to a headcanon with Rose Granger-Weasley being adopted by Ron and Hermione, while Hugo is their biological son. And so, as a result, I imagined her inner conflict with her mother, her having to be perfect all the time because she has an inferiority complex and doesn't want to disappoint her parents' expectations, the various problems she might get into by being the only one really ""different"" in a family of redheaded white people.

What about reactive armour with layers which would be destroyed by the unforgivables and other major spells while protecting the wearer ? Having a large amount of shrunken Shields that would be automatically unshrunken and fixed on your hand when one is destroyed ? Bludgers who are enchanted to aim incoming spells ?

Fred and George have demonstrated that enchanted clothes can be usefull for minor spells. And they only use a simple Protego enchantment, nothing more powerfull. That means even civilians, with average knowledge of battel spells, can produce armour. What would be the creations of masters in transfiguration, potions and enchantment ?

harrypotter,"I thought this was a funny one - in the amazing deleted scene from HBP (that they should have kept in) we hear the choir sing the beautiful song 'In Noctem,' and it made me think of something funny. Almost all HP spells have a Latin base, so I realized that a rule of choir practice has to be that they don't even have their wands in their pockets because (as established by Baruffio) you can do magic just by saying the wrong word even if you're not intending to do magic and don't know what the spell does. Half of the song is in Latin, so if they had their wands with them I'll bet they'd blow themselves up.

harrypotter,"McGonagall: ""Granger, Hermione Jean.""

Hermione ran forward and pulled the hat onto her head.  She heard a tickly little voice musing aloud.

""A lot of native intelligence here, very clever and keen.  Ravenclaw might suit you well...""

Hermione wondered if the hat could hear her worrying about her future prospects.

""Yes, of course.  We're both in here for the moment.  You know, keenness doesn't really cover it.  You might be better placed in Slytherin.  You're more ambitious than most and they could use...""

*Not Slytherin*, she practically screeched it aloud.  *They have a terrible reputation!*

""I know, child, I'm trying to do them a favor...""

*Not Slytherin!*  And doubting the hat's intentions now, *Not Ravenclaw either!*

""Damn.  GRYFFINDOR.""  Hermione put on a brave face as the hat was lifted off her head.

McGonagall pursed her lips as Neville Longbottom approached at her call a few minutes later.  She had received a couple of letters from Augusta over the holidays and wasn't encouraged.  For her part, Professor McGonagall thought the Longbottom matriarch had odd ideas about how to raise a child but, having no children of her own, couldn't be entirely certain.  She lowered the hat onto Neville's head, and it dropped right down over his eyes.

""Ho, Longbottom!  It's been a while since I last spoke to a member of your family.  Keeping well, are they?""

*Um,* Neville began.

""Never mind, boy, just breaking the ice.  Oh, dear.""  The hat paused and Neville felt the strangest sensation that there was a mind inside his head, a mind besides his own, actually looking around.  ""Oh, dear.  You poor kid.  Oh, wait...""

If asked in the moment, Neville would have described it as feeling as if some mental boxes had been shifted aside.

""You'd make a good Hufflepuff, you know.  Professor Sprout and you will get along swimmingly.""

*But my gran says Huffs are a bunch of duffers and it's probably the best i can do.*

""Your gran doesn't have the insight on you that I do,"" grumbled the hat quietly, as a few cerebral closets were opened and gently sorted.  ""Oh.  Oh!""

*What?*

""GRYFFINDOR!""

*What?  Are you sure?*

""Never been surer, kid.  Off you go, GRYFFINDOR!""

A few more students came and went with somewhat less drama, until...

""Malfoy, Draco.""

The hat came down over Malfoy's sneer as he waited for it to confidently tell him and the rest of the school what he knew was coming, but the voice inside his head surprised him.

""Hufflepuff.""

*What?!  NO!  My father will...I'm supposed to be a Slytherin, like my father!  You don't know what it's like...*

""No, lad, YOU don't know what it's like.  Huff House is full of good people from all walks of life, far more socially conscious than you are, I daresay, and you would benefit from meeting and getting to know them.  Open your eyes a little.""

*I can't!  When my father hears about this...*

harrypotter,"(nobody will read this, it's a weird post) 

Hi, I was recently playing on Potterworld (Java edition) and was intrigued by the way casting spells there works. Basically, you right click your wand and the spells appear on your hotbar. If you press Q it changes hotbar. Then, if you select the spell with a number or right click it from the inventory, the spell is selected and left clicking with the wand will cast it. 

So, I wonder if something like that is doable in MCBE world. 

I'm fully aware that some things are not doable in BE and using only commands, so I'll change something. 

First, hotbars. In BE you can use the /replaceitem just fine to make the player have a certain hotbar, so I'd use that or /give to give the player the items. However, unlike on Java, you can't save hotbars, so there's no way to know the hotbar that the player had BEFORE having the spells one selected to restore it. A solution to this might be simply having the world only for that purpose and nothing else, so the player wouldn't even have other stuff in the hotbar. 

To activate spells, I'd drop items. The dropped item would cause the spell to happen, but here's a problem:

The way that Ron and Hermione were like “oh yeah we just popped down to the chamber of secrets to grab a couple of baselisk fangs” casually like they were explaining how they went down to the shop for some beers.

The chamber of secrets can only be accessed by a parseltongue, which is a protection placed on it by slytherin himself so only his heir can be granted access. To think it could be fooled by a non parseltongue making hissing noises at it is pretty ludicrous.

Also, with the diadem, the fiend fire is set in the room of requirement and of all the attacks that could of been possibly used by crabbe(?) in that situation, he just so happened to chose the one very specific spell that can destroy horcruxes.

This wouldn’t be too much of an issue apart from the fact that so much effort and time went into finding and understanding which physical object can destroy a horcrux, and then at the very end they are like “oh actually there is a spell that can do it straight away lol”",Fiend fire and the chamber of secrets,1673005483

You can’t change things that have already happened, you can only use time turners to potentially alter the outcome of events you have no prior knowledge of.

For those unaware of the game mechanics, the player has a finite amount of time in the game where you play out almost every day in a calendar year. The main part of this is going to school, meeting up with your friends for various story beats, and actually doing the classes themselves. This involves certain days where the player is quizzed by the teacher or taking final exams. The character has to balance school, personal development and relationships on top of investigating murders, for example. There’s also part-time jobs to earn money outside of the “dungeon crawler” part of the game which is turn-based.


I think this desire is based on my love for Harry’s everyday school life in a magical school outside of the “saving the world” plot lines.

I thought of a story where they are all alive and hermione is actually Sirius’ biological daughter. Although i loves this character madly, he actually acts like an overgrown child and therefore plays his role as Harry’s godfather but doesn’t want to become a father. Hermione’s mother leaves her in front of Sirius’s house and he, against the will of the other marauders who were also willing to adopt her personally and raise her as their own daughter, decides to give her up for adoption because he doesn’t want to be her father and he didn’t want responsibility. He wanted to enjoy life as a man without problems and when he takes her in his arms for the first time at the request of the marauders he doesn’t feel that feeling that every father should feel, which James felt with Harry, but just feels an enormous weight on his shoulders but, he calls her Hermione before leaving her at the muggle orphanage because he knew a muggle name would make his mother turn in her grave and that’s why she calls herself by a short name because she didn’t want anything from the man who had left her without caring. They meets years later at the station when everyone is accompanying Harry for his first year and again when Harry invites her over to his house for the holidays having become great friends with the brilliant but silent little girl who has a morbid obsession with playing by the rules. They slowly learns more about her life and that to adopt Hermione was a horrible family that mistreats her, especially her adoptive father who punishes her whenever she doesn’t follow the rules, and then Sirius repents and tries to bond with his daughter and raise her and things like that. Obviously it will be a difficult path and Sirius will have to live with remorse but as soon as he sees her exactly as he was at her age, alone and with few friends he can really call his family, unwanted without knowing why by both of her biological parents and hated by the foster ones, he feels that feeling he hadn’t felt many years ago when he first picked her up. Hermione had his eyes, his hair, his instilled spirit rebellious and loyal to the point of error and that girl, little but strong as a lion, was his responsibility, she was a child, his child, and he had disappointed her already too much. If I weren’t so bad at writing I would do it but I leave the idea here in case someone wants to use it tell me because I would really be happy to read this fanfic.

She becomes friends with the Marauders, initially suspicious, even if Sirius immediately feels a strange sensation towards her, as if his world suddenly depends on the smile of a little girl who he knows very well he doesn’t love, not the way adults love themselves but the way he saw James’ parents love him, until they see Hermione’s scar. She meets her father, who died before knowing that she was his daughter, and eventually Sirius discovers that Hermione is his biological daughter from the future and for the first time in his life, this life, he had a family that was his own.","Harry Potter FanFiction idea, again, because no one thinks of me so please,pleaseeeeeeees, If anyone wants to write it, let me know.",1672964273

I mean, he had to know that it would eventually come out that Voldemort was indeed back, so how bad would it have been if Harry had gotten blamed? When it came out the Ministry would look bad for not only Denying the truth but punishing a kid for it. Plus I can't imagine the ministry would throw a child in Azkaban so Harry's punishment would be less as the ministry could just claim that Harry was a confused kid.

Instead, he takes the full blame which would have had him sent to Azkaban if he had chosen to Surender to the Minister. And the ministry uses this to undermine him. 

I guess my question is could Dumbledore have known as early as OoTP that he would be dead before Voldemort was defeated and that Harry would need the support of the wizarding world to win, and therefore take the blame to keep Harry's 'reputation' from being besmirched? or was he just shielding Harry from whatever punishment the ministry might have for him?",Did Dumbledore know he would not see the end of Voldemort,1672958491

Death Eaters have infiltrated at this point and there is  dueling everywhere. Suddenly, turning around, you see, as if in slow motion, a wall blasted apart and everywhere, your friends lay screaming and dying.

harrypotter,"While obviously I think her end goal of giving house elves fair working conditions was the right one. She was too self righteous to actually listen to what the elves themselves wanted.

And she's probably right when she says that the elves think that way because they've been conditioned to, but that doesn't change the fact that it's counter intuitive to want to force them to be free. I think that's the point Hagrid and Ron and everyone else is trying to make when they try to talk her out of it. We see that ultimately none of them agree with house elves being mistreated and enslaved, they just don't think Hermione will be able to set them free if they don't want to be free.

She got too greedy with her short and long term goals. Instead of getting them wages her short term goal probably should've been to pass legislation to ensure they're not mistreated, then hopefully elves would start realizing their value and want and seek freedom for themselves, just like it happened with Dobby. We see how fair treatment does so much to improve their lives with Dobby and Kreacher. Her long term goals should've been getting them fair wages, and it's a goal the elves themselves should help her with or want to help her with.

It's an interesting conundrum that shows that the right thing maybe obvious sometimes but that doesn't mean everyone will see that way, and that doesn't mean the solution is equally as obvious. If Hermione hadn't been so self righteous and had listened to run SPEW would've been far better received by pretty much everyone, but more importantly by the house elves themselves.",Hermione went about SPEW the wrong way,1673630600
harrypotter,"In Hinduism mythology, there is a God Krishna. Before Krishna was born, his uncle (mother's brother) heard a prophecy that his nephew would be the one to kill him. Therefore he ordered every child of his sister to be killed and also to imprison the sister (The uncle was a king, btw). 

Krishna was born in the prison cell. His uncle tried to kill him in the cell, but due to his mother's love, Krishna survived. 

That's how his uncle, Kansa, became his mortal enemy.

Other aspects: Kansa (the uncle) was afraid of death. Kansa was believed to be able to communicate with snakes too.

harrypotter,"Can we stop with this question already?! I get so tired of seeing it. It is such a ridiculous question and I don't just mean because wizards basically shun anything that is a muggle-specific invention or because they would be able to cast enchantments to protect themselves, but because it takes away from what is supposed to be a magical world. I enjoy Harry Potter because it allows me to escape into another world. Is that world perfect? Of course not. Does it have parallels to the real world? Absolutely.  

But adding guns to that world doesn't add anything to the experience. If anything it takes away from it. The worst curses in the Wizarding Universe can't just be used at will. They require intent (""You have to mean it"") to be effective. So to kill someone, you have to *want* to kill them. To torture someone you have to *want* to cause pain. I think this distinction is important because it provides more insight into the motivations and qualities of the characters. 

Harry tries to torture Bellatrix but his curse isn't successful because he's not the type of person that would want to torture someone. This distinction is what makes the characters in Harry Potter so relatable. We have all had moments where we let ourselves be ruled by our emotions, but we don't act on the thoughts we might have because that's not who we truly are and reason takes over. Adding guns to the equation would eliminate the nuances of the story and make the characters and the world incredibly one dimensional.

After what happened with the Second Wizarding war, perhaps its smart for it to become an option if the Auror chooses, to be trained in the art of firearm usage/safety.  I'm not talking about rifles or shotguns, but concealed handguns.  For the most part, the Auror still acts as an Auror usually does, and still uses magic/wand.

But knowing how to use a handgun efficiently and keeping it hidden from potential enemies, could be beneficial.  From what we know about Dark Wizards, they don't use muggle weapons.  If confronted by a dark wizard, a handgun could be a surprise towards the dark arts user.  Giving the good guys an edge.  Combing the art of wielding magic well with knowledge/wand and the advantages a handgun has.

I've just finished going through the first few movies again (books up after movies), and something about courses like transfiguration have always bothered me.

harrypotter,"People are always on about how the films removed this and cut out that or whatever, and even me included too. I love the books and some scenes deserve to be set in the big screen, but what about things that were never in the books? And was only in the films. Just to clarify, when i mean additions, i don't mean changes. Like the film didn't add harry killing quirrel, they just changed it. And this isn't all of the things they actually added, just some of the worst i believe.

POA is widely considered like the best of the franchise, and i honestly could never see it. At best it's bad and at worst is terrible. But when thinking about it, there's one thing i usually used to overlook, and that is lupin. I never really considered about him that much, but recently i made a post about him, and it got me thinking. Why do they add him talking about lily so much? It makes no sense and it kinda feels like he had a thing for her or something, but why would he? He barely says a word about lily in the books? Comes completely out of nowhere. It's like it's a complete 180 of his character, he loves james simple as that, where was lily? Yeah, nowhere.

HBP is like the complete opposite of POA, everyone pretty much knows it sucks and yeah they're right. This film is complete doo doo. And this one has not just one bad addition but more, and one of them concerns the character of slughorn. And again, his relationship with lily. I don't know why people say they prefer his story about the fish in the film? I never really gelled with it and find it kinda dumb. Like in the books he tells about him what about happened that night his parents died, which is so much more impactful. We rarely get to even really see the truth about what happened his parents died, and in the next book we actually see it happened. And it's a shame, because it feels like it's left forgotten in the films.

But oh know HBP couldn't just help itself, and added an even dumber addition, the burning of the burrow. This one makes like absolutely no sense. Not only is not even canon, not only is it never brought up, not only does it take away one of the best highlights of the book with harry and scrimgeour in the burrow during this time in the book, we also get that stupid scene harry and ginny. It's so baffling and just completely useless. Like the next time we see the burrow, it's completely fine and is never brought up again. It's like you never fred or george be like ''ah man this shit reminds of the time the burrow burned down'' or something like that idk. And also not just that, it looks completely ugly af. The stupid ass shaky cam hurts my eyes so much and gives me chronic diarrhea.

And that brings me to another scene that also has some stupid shaky cam, and isn't in the books, that horrible chase scene in DH part 1. I honestly even forgot about this and wasn't even going to mention it, but that doesn't it mean it can get off scot free. This shit is just so like just dumb. THEY COULD EASILY JUST APPARATE AWAY! AND I CAN'T EVEN SEE WHAT'S GOING ON! AND HOW DO THE SNATCHERS EVEN FIND THEM!? WHAT! I'm sorry, i'm usually not like this when watching films, but this just is just so stupid and makes no sense at all.

And we're still on the same film, because guess what, it even get's worse. That stupid ass dance scene with harry and hermione. And before anyone says this is just some dumb shit between friends, even emma watson said in an interview, she saw this scene as like something that could happen between friends and like they both think they could be something more. And even the next scene hermione and harry look into their eyes lovingly, and even she also says ''what if we just grow old together''. And also the fact that they cut out this line, that pretty much ended the harry/hermione debate and if they would end up together:

*“After you left,” he said in a low voice, grateful for the fact that Ron’s face was hidden, “she cried for a week. Probably longer, only she didn’t want me to see. There were loads of nights when we never even spoke to each other. With you gone . . .” He could not finish; it was only now that Ron was here again that Harry fully realized how much his absence had cost them. “She’s like my sister,” he went on. “I love her like a sister and I reckon she feels the same way about me. It’s always been like that. I thought you knew.”*

I like the song they're dancing to at least, but other than that, that scene is just there to give harmione shippers some a wet dream or whatever. And it even stings ever harder because the scene before this, is quite possibly the worst scene in all of HP canon (not tcc), harry and ron's fight. This shit is so baffling and just downright idiotic. And especially the line, ''your parents are dead! YOU HAVE NO FAMILY!'' Like book ron would never outright or even come close to saying something like that, that shit is on another level of bad. It's just mind boggling the extent that these films would go to antagonize ron and demonize him, they spend all of their stupid ass camping scene montage or whatever, to facilitate that there might be something between harry and hermione and ooh ron's jealous or whatever. It's useless they're just building up for this stupid fight for half the movie and it's just a complete joke. It's like it's memed so much to the point where it really is a joke at this point. I hate this scene with all my heart, and yeah maybe it's a changed scene, but the entire point of the fight is different from the book, and the film just again, makes up some dumbass BS.

That's all i could remember honestly, there might be alot more. Just to be clear, i'm not saying an adaptation shouldn't add nothing or whatever, should stick 100% to it? Nah, where's the fun in that. But just adding dumbass shit and making up complete nonsense like these examples, isn't any better. In my next post i do want to discuss a scene where i think the films do something right, by actually adding something that wasn't in the book.

harrypotter,"Upon a current reread of the series, I find similarities between Harry Potter and Hindu Mythology. At the same time, Rowling pulled elements from the Christian mythos for her books and some from other myths. Some parts of the series speak to me as an Indian reading the series. Let me start with the apparent similarities between the story elements of Harry Potter and famous Indian mythological stories. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Prophecy that Harry must kill Voldemort bares similarities to the story in the Bhagavatam of how an evil king named Kansa received a premonition that the eighth nephew of his would be his killer. While in Harry's case, it was the same except with Voldemort, and how did the two react? 

&amp;#x200B;

Kansa went on a murder spree, killing seven of his nephews before the eighth, a reincarnation of Lord Vishnu himself, and escaped his clutches in the form of Krishna, and Voldemort began targeting the Potters. While in Harry's case, something similar happens when he destroys Voldemort as a baby for the time being, losing his parents in the process. While this is one of the more apparent similarities I have noticed, the trope of a chosen hero or chosen one is quite common in stories.  

&amp;#x200B;

The second thing that struck me was the same scenario in the Mahabharat that led to the death of a famous warrior called Abimanyu was almost the same as the maze in the fourth book. The first is that Harry, like Abimanyu, had to cross a maze to reach the centre of it. In both cases, they found themselves fighting for their lives while no one else could see what was transpiring inside the maze. Finally, both cases ended with some form of tragic circumstances, with Harry's being that he saw Cedric Diggory get killed and Voldemorts return, and Abimanyu lost his life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, Dumbledore's character and Voldemorts resemble the characters of Shakuni and Lord Krishna from the Mahabharata. Especially both are the only ones that can counter the other schemes and plans. Eventually, leading to the death of the other; however, in Dumbledore's case, he dies trying to bring down Voldemort. At the same time, Dumbledore's death and the fall of Bhisma, the grandsire of the dynasty that is the centre of the Mahabharata, are almost the same.

&amp;#x200B;

 Given that many people stop to grieve the loss of both, at the same time, Dumbledore being unable to stop the rise of Voldemort for the second time is an uncanny similarity to how Bhisma was unable to stop the war that is the centrepiece of an Indian epic called the Mahabharata from happening.

harrypotter,"before you say no, of course not, look at the scene:

&gt;As Dumbledore spoke, Harry heard a rustle behind him and rather‬ thought Kingsley whispered something. He could have sworn too that‬ he felt something brush against his side, a gentle something like a‬ draft or bird wings, but looking down he saw nothing there.‬
…
&gt;‪“Miss Edgecombe,” said Umbridge at once, “tell us how long these‬ ‪meetings have been going on, dear. You can simply nod or shake your‬ ‪head, I’m sure that won’t make the spots worse. Have they been happening regularly over the last six months?”‬ Harry felt a horrible plummeting in his stomach. This was it, they‬ ‪had hit a dead end of solid evidence that not even Dumbledore would be able to shift aside…‬
…
‪&gt;Everyone in the room was gazing at the top of Marietta’s face. Only‬ ‪her eyes were visible between the pulled up robes and her curly fringe.‬ ‪Perhaps it was a trick of the firelight, but her eyes looked oddly blank.‬
‪&gt;And then — to Harry’s utter amazement — Marietta shook her head.‬
‪&gt;Umbridge looked quickly at Fudge and then back at Marietta.‬ ‪“I don’t think you understood the question, did you, dear? I’m asking whether you’ve been going to these meetings for the past six‬ ‪months? You have, haven’t you?”‬
‪&gt;Again, Marietta shook her head.‬
‪“What do you mean by shaking your head, dear?” said Umbridge‬ ‪in a testy voice.‬
&gt;‪“I would have thought her meaning was quite clear,” said Professor‬ ‪McGonagall harshly. “There have been no secret meetings for the past‬ ‪six months. Is that correct, Miss Edgecombe?”‬
‪&gt;Marietta nodded.‬
&gt;‪“But there was a meeting tonight!” said Umbridge furiously.‬ ‪“There was a meeting, Miss Edgecombe, you told me about it, in the‬ ‪Room of Requirement! And Potter was the leader, was he not, Potter‬ ‪organized it, Potter — why are you shaking your head, girl?”‬
&gt;‪“Well, usually when a person shakes their head,” said McGonagall‬ ‪coldly, “they mean ‘no.’ So unless Miss Edgecombe is using a form of‬ ‪sign language as yet unknown to humans—”‬
‪&gt;Professor Umbridge seized Marietta, pulled her around to face her,‬ ‪and began shaking her very hard.‬
…
&gt; ‪Marietta was standing exactly where Umbridge had released her.‬ ‪She seemed neither perturbed by Umbridge’s sudden attack, nor relieved by her release. She was still clutching her robe up to her oddly‬ ‪blank eyes, staring straight ahead of her. A sudden suspicion connected to Kingsley’s whisper and the thing he had felt shoot past him‬ ‪sprang into Harry’s mind.‬

(this is copied and paraphrased a bit from ch27. i hope my mobile formatting is okay.)

now, i always assumed that he’d confunded her. perhaps even obliviated her. but on a recent reread, i realized that a confundus charm’s purpose is to *confuse.* it does not make you do what the caster wants you to or believe what they want you to believe, unless they instruct you verbally perhaps (we never see this happen, but it’s implied by snape in PoA and DH when he uses the confundus as a reason to discredit people that you can use it to convince someone of incorrect information). so why is marietta shaking her head here, rather than agreeing with umbridge? why is she so blank and docile and nonreactive?

harry gets “a suspicion” as to what’s been cast, indicating he finds this behaviour familiar, recognizable. at this point, he has never seen anyone confunded. i checked with potter-search.com and at that point, the confundus has only been referenced: by snape in PoA, and by barty in GoF. the first time we see someone confunded on-page is mclaggen in HBP: he goes “lumbering off in the wrong direction” and is confused and stumbling about knocking into things for the rest of the day. he doesn’t lose awareness. nothing like marietta, who’s not confused at all. she’s calm and cooperative. harry saw plenty of that in “moody’s” defense class in GoF.

Harry potter has some of the best selling books of all time, something like that is hard to compare to, especially when there are hundreds and hundred of other books extremely well made that dont even come close, sure its harry potter and that but when you think of ""harry potter"" you think of Daniel Radcliffe, not harry potters kids, its just become so iconic and well chiseld into our brains a new franchise would be overlooked and wouldnt be able to compare.

My second reasoning is what story would there be to tell, she says its gonna be about the aftermath and people really want to see it but the story kinda ended at that moment, it would be hard to introduce a new villain as there are not really any others mentioned and it wouldnt be very creative, sure there are other worlds in the wizarding universe but why not just make a new story not a hp one.

My last reason is targeted audience, it would be very hard to do as older people or anyone above 10 really would find the original franchise to be to good and nostalgic to be surpassed and the newer generations with the world is advancing would be alot more put off because of jk being transphobic which caused massive backlash

harrypotter,"I don't have a bad opinion of Slytherin house. I can find the given value in every Hogwarts house. In Ravenclaw, for example, knowledge, the desire to know and the love of science. In Hufflepuff, honesty, integrity and honor. In Gryffindor, determination, courage, strength and loyalty. And in the Slytherin house, cunning, ingenuity, ambition, willingness to act and dedication.

I respect all houses equally, but I feel that for some reason the Slytherin house is considered by many people to be the worst and most evil house to belong to. After all, those malicious and evil people who basically do not even deserve the epithet ""human"" end up in this house. Perhaps they are not worthy of being placed in another Hogwarts house based on their own limitations, cowardice, weakness, stupidity and evil and malicious violent, psychopaths behavior. In this way, they spoil the Slytherin reputation and everyone identifies the Slytherin house with these people.

(I have often wondered why there isn't a fifth house, where the useless, incapable of living, or the evil and perverted good-for-nothings are assigned? The name of this house could be MOSGLAMACH. From Old Irish MOSACH; shaggy, rough, bristly bristly, grumpy, surly. And from SGLAMHACH - hungry dog or mastiff - and the animal of the house could be a mad dog with a foaming mouth.)

People with weak abilities, or possibly characterless and infinitely evil people (who are not suitable for any other Hogwarts house due to their inability to live and their inferior character) are just an afterthought.

Apart from them, the Slytherin house could be just as worthy of respect and honor as the other houses. Because not only vile and inferior people came from this house. E.g. Severus Snape - whom I don't think I need to introduce to anyone (I'd rather describe him as a misunderstood, tragic hero), Narcissa Malfoy, who didn't tell Voldemort that Harry Potter was alive, Regulus Black, who was the first to confront Voldemort by stealing his horcrux, or Horace Slughorn - one of my personal favorite characters - who was an extremely utilitarian and calculating man, yet still helped in the fight against Voldemort.

However, there is something about Slytherin house that I still can't wrap my head around to this day. That is, how could a supposedly ""wise wizard"" who is one of the founders of Hogwarts be able to leave a monster for posterity whose task is to destroy innocent children - just because they are ""mudbloods""? I've also read a theory that Salazar did this to protect wizards from traitors who might betray them to the ""muggle inquisitors"" and possibly tell them all the secrets of wizarding society. But I think it's extremely drastic and rude to unleash a Basilisk-level monster on ignorant and innocent children - who know nothing and want no harm. 

This act of Slytherin Salazar basically defined his personality, and it is why everyone considers the Slytherin house to be the most despised house - at least among those who do not belong to it. (E.g.: Everyone at Hogwarts was always cheering against for Slytherin - especially in the Quidditch matches and every Hogwarts houses hated the Slytherin house.) 

The problem is that there is no concrete explanation in the books as to why the founder of the Slytherin house was a potential child killer - which is almost the same level of evil as Voldemort.",What drove Slytherin Salazar to become a child killer and establish Slytherin's bad reputation for generations?,1673538328
harrypotter,"So I’m home sick for the next week and I’m absolutely miserable and in a lot of pain and looking for well-written HP fics. I’ve read the entire series, (a few times over the years) and I’ve just finished the movies, again, day before yesterday.

What I tried to find yesterday, was honestly well-written fanfic that continues the story after Deathly Hallows.

It plays a huge part in Deathly Hallows, but I can't remember if this rule is exclusive to the Elder Wand. If it's a rule for all wands, then it'd be pure chaos. Witches and wizards would be constantly trying to regain the trust of their wand; disarming whoever disarmed them, in an endless cycle of revenge dueling.

For instance, did Snape ever regain ownership of his own wand from Hermione after what happened in the Shrieking Shack?

A couple years ago I listened to the audiobook of Cursed Child on a long lonely road trip and I honestly didn’t hate it! I didn’t think it was great and had some wtf moments, but as I was driving alone in the dark I was happy to be back in this world. My girlfriend hasn’t read the script or seen the play so everything will be fresh to her. I see it’s now a slimmed down 3 hour show so that has peaked my interest. While it’s hard to find anything positive about Cursed Child on the internet, every review I’ve seen of the stage show has said it’s fantastic, the visuals are stunning and well worth it.

Harry Potter has played a massive role in both our lives and our relationship. I have an extreme case of Dyslexia and the Harry Potter books are what got me to learn to read. As I grew older, Harry learning to cope with his alienation from his peers helped me to cope with the alienation I was feeling. The last couple of years have renewed my interest in the series, turning to the books for solace to help find comfort to confront the adult world. So yes, this series means a lot to me and if this is my one chance to see anything Harry Potter in person, I don’t think it’s something to pass up.

It will also be fitting because I remember I was sitting outside by myself in New York City when I was around 11 or 12 years old when I finished reading Deathly Hallows and was a defining moment of my life. That moment was the first time I really felt myself growing up.

Proof from canon that Ron is a terrible friend.

1. Ron is rude. In Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, when Ron first meets Harry, he asks Harry if he really has the scar and stares at Harry's scar, making Harry uncomfortable.
2. Ron is insensitive. After the Levitation Charm lesson in Sorcerer's Stone, Ron talks mean about Hermione behind her back and makes her go cry in the bathroom. And, no, it wasn't something Ron said to Harry in private, Ron made his mean comments about Hermione in a crowded corridor.
3. Ron approves of murder. In Chamber of Secrets, while discussing why Riddle might have gotten an award for Special Services to the School, Ron says ""maybe he murdered Myrtle, that would have done everyone a favor. So Ron is actually Draco like.
4. Ron has misplaced priorities. In Prisoner of Azkaban, Ron commits the sin of caring more about a pet than a friend. The bottom line is that the falling out between Ron and Hermione in Prisoner of Azkaban is Ron's fault. The reason it is Ron's fault is because of how inappropriately he handled the initial disappearance of Scabbers. Ron was absolutely in the wrong to shake bedsheets in Hermione's face and yell at her in one of the most public settings of Hogwarts, the Gryffindor Common Room. Ron later meanly freezes Hermione out of the food party in the Gryffindor Common Room after their Quidditch win over Ravenclaw. When Harry tries to help Hermione, he yells again and makes poor Hermione run off crying. When confronted by Harry by this, Ron unfairly says ""If she just acted like she was sorry"" The problem with this is that Ron had no right to expect an apology from Hermione for anything unless and until he first apologized to her for shaking bedsheets in her face, yelling at her, and humiliating her in front of the whole common room. Personally, the ONLY way I will EVER apologize to anyone for anything is if the person who feels wronged by me informs me of how they feel they've been wronged by me in a 100% calm, 100% polite, 100% classy, 100% non yelling, and 100% non in your face manner. If someone yells at me, humiliates me, gets in my face, and shakes materials in my face, I will NEVER apologize to them for anything even if it is an indisputable truism that I owe them an apology unless and until they first apologize to me for the yelling, humiliation, in your faceness, etc. Bare in mind that being humiliated is a MUCH worse position to be in than the position Ron was in. Then, later on, Ron won't listen to Hagrid when Hagrid gives his correct perspective that Ron should value his friend more than rats. Remember: FRIENDS SHOULD ALWAYS BE VALUED ABOVE PETS! NO EXCEPTIONS!. Even minor level friendships such as Harry Potter and Katie Bell should always be valued above pets. Harry should care MUCH more about Katie than about Hedwig. Since Ron and Hermione are actually close friends, it's MUCH more true that Ron should care far more about Hermione than about Scabbers. The caveat is this: If Ron would have approached Hermione in a classy and polite manner and informed her of what he thought had happened and what his evidence was in a classy and polite manner, he would then have been justified in expecting an apology from Hermione. Here's what Ron should have done: He should have left the bedsheets in the dorm, calmly approached Hermione in the common room, and asked her for a word. He should then have asked her to follow him up to his dorm and talked to her in private. He then should have showed Hermione the bedsheets and cat hairs and explained that Scabbers was gone and that the evidence pointed to Crookshanks eating Scabbers without yelling. Had Ron handled the situation this way and Hermione still completely denied that the evidence pointed to Crookshanks eating Scabbers, Ron would have been MUCH more justified in becoming angry with Hermione after that. But, Ron needed to understand that no one is going to apologize for anything if you yell at them, humiliate them, or shake materials in their face. Acting like that is only going to rile people up and make people angry and defensive. Being yelled at will also freak most people out. While ""friends should always be valued above pets"" is a hill I will forever die on, I would have MUCH more respect for the opinion that Hermione should have apologized to Ron if Ron himself had handled himself in a classy manner like he should have.
5. Ron is untrusting. Ron falls out with Harry in Goblet of Fire because he doesn't doesn't trust Harry enough. After knowing him for three plus years, Ron should know Harry well enough both to know that he would never have put his own name in the Goblet of Fire knowing the extra attention that would bring as Harry hated fame and attention AND that Harry would NEVER go behind his back or exclude him. Ron knows Harry well enough that he should have trusted Harry and not been suspicious of him. If I were Harry Potter, I would never have forgiven Ron for this betrayal and would never have had anything to do with him ever again. After the 1st Task, Harry should have removed Ron from his life and fully embraced his friendship with Hermione, who proved through her loyalty and support after Harry's name came out of the Goblet of Fire that she and not Ron was Harry's true Bestie. If Harry needed more than one best friend he should have become closer with Neville, Ginny, or Luna. Always remember that it is an indisputable truism that Ron was 1000% unjustified in not supporting, not believing, and not trusting Harry here. Always remember that it is an indisputable truism that this falling out was 100% Ron's fault and 0% Harry's fault. Harry literally didn't do anything wrong and Ron had NO legitimate justification for not supporting, believing, and trusting Harry more here.
6. In Order of the Phoenix, Ron is rude to first years in his prefect duty and calls them midgets.
7. In Half Blood Prince, Ron rudely takes an armchair by fire from an innocent first year. (Hermione does the right thing and gives the armchair back to the first year.)
8. Ron is observed to be unkind by Luna. On page 310 of Half Blood Prince, Luna says that Ron is unkind and that she had noticed that last year. Consider the fact that lovely and awesome Luna feels no affection for Ron and thinks him unkind.
9. In Half Blood Prince, Ron is mean to his Quidditch teammates and makes Demzela cry.
10. The worst part of all: Ron is disloyal. Ron literally betrayed and abandoned both Harry and Hermione on the road in the middle of a WAR. When you betray and abandon your two best friends on the road in the middle of a WAR, then you are NOT loyal but are a fair weather friend. You can't blame the Horcrux because both Harry and Hermione were it is well and neither of them ever abandoned each other or the mission. You also can't blame hunger. Neither Harry nor Hermione had any more to eat than Ron did. You can't blame conditions either. Harry and Hermione didn't have any comfortable beds or anything any more than Ron did. Even in general, Harry and Hermione had better attitudes toward the Horcrux Hunt than Ron and both did far less worrying and whining than Ron did. Harry was right on the money when he said that Ron knew he signed up for. Ron knew that the Horcrux Hunt wasn't going to be flowers and chocolates. This was the moment that made Ron 1000% irredeemable and proved for good that Hermione and not Ron was Harry's true Bestie and truly loyal friend. Ron literally betrayed and abandoned both Harry and Hermione on the road in the middle of a WAR. When the going got tough, Ron got going and ditched his friends. That's a fair weather friend for you.

harrypotter,"Hello friends. So you know how in the Prisoner of Azkaban movie (especially the first dementor scene on the train to Hogwarts) the screen effect symbolizing the dementor stealing the soul of a person? I am of the opinion that, compared to some of the amazing videography of POA, this was a really poor representation of the effect. 

On the other hand, Sirius laying by the lake at the end of the movie and the soul-mass(?) temporarily exiting/reentering his body was absolutely fantastic. I just really didn't care for the blurry screen effect; it just doesn't seem like the right way to animate it to me.  However, at the same time, I'm not the type of person to ordinarily complain without trying to come up with a better solution and honestly nothing immediately occurs to me as a better portrayal method.

This is a very niche conversation exclusively pertaining to the POA movie's portrayal of the dementors attempting to suck out a person's soul / feeding on a person.

I know that book vs. movie discussion threads are extremely common, and one thing I have noticed is that a lot of people will also discuss how the changes that were made to the movies affected how they felt about a particular character's death as opposed to how they felt when they read the books.  Now, while many people have expressed that the movies lessened the impact of some characters' deaths for them, I am wondering if there are any instances where the movies might have heightened the impact of a character's death.

Personally, I noticed that Hedwig's death actually hit me harder when I watched *Deathly Hallows: Part 1* as opposed to when I read her death in the book.  There's just something about my favorite Snowy Owl's dying while actively trying to protect Harry (movie death) as opposed to dying while sitting in a cage (book death) that caused me to lose more tears while watching the movie versus while reading the book.

harrypotter,"During the scenes going back to the Triwizard Tournament, it cuts to the Ludo Bagman commentary that was happening in the background of Goblet of Fire. In that, we get this:

&gt;If you’re from Hogwarts. Give me a cheer.

&gt;*There’s a loud cheer*

&gt;If you’re from Durmstrang — give me a cheer

&gt;*There’s a loud cheer*

&gt;AND IF YOU’RE FROM BEAUXBATONS GIVE ME A CHEER

&gt;*There’s a slightly limp cheer*

I’m unsure whether it was just an abysmal attempt at humour in Fleur doing poorest in the tasks, or if the writers genuinely thought there were less people there from Beaxbatons. 

Just to give perspective, Beaxbatons is stated to have a far bigger castle than both Hogwarts and Durmstrang. While some of that might just be for show, you have to take into consideration that ,unlike Hogwarts, Beaxbaton’s general population isn’t only from one country as they house wizards from numerous Central European countries surrounding France. 

Granted, I imagine it’s similar with Durmstrang, but they certainly wouldn’t give off a “limp cheer”.

harrypotter,"A lot of people like to criticize Yates for his work but I personally thought he was one of the better directors for Potter. Im speaking about only his 4 Potter films as I think the FB films weren’t consistent or coherent enough as a story. 

When I look at Yates’s work, I think of camera moving and imagery storytelling. His films, outside of Alfonso Cuaron, felt the most cinematic and emotional of any in the series. In most of his films, he gets great performances from the actors and always has this gritty tone to the films that were needed for the back half of the series. His adaptations were decent but I attribute that to the lack of runtime in the film(s). Him and Steve Kloves had great chemistry together in my opinion. 

If David Yates was around given the option to direct Goblet of Fire, a far better narrative than Order of Phoenix imo, I’m sure we would’ve gotten a more darker and tonally consistent film that Newell’s Goblet of Fire. 

•The Death eater attack would’ve been a little longer. 

•The Dragon chase would be significantly toned down or removed 

•The 3rd task would’ve included more creatures and jump scares for the audience.

There are a few near misses, with Hagrid and Snape, and Hermione goes ""see, Harry? We would have been seen!"" But.. she used it to go to all those extra classes all year? And I'm assuming she was in classrooms with other students and teachers. So she was clearly seen a lot, right?

And also, Hermione argues that Harry can't run in and get Scabbers in Hagrid's hut, as past Harry seeing himself, would think that he was going mad, or that some dark magic was going on. She even says, that there are stories about wizards seeing themselves, and killing themselves. But again, if Hermione went in, and explained the situation, primarily to herself, surely that would be problem solved? I mean, she knows that she has a time turner, and if her future self came to that exact moment, and explained the situation, surely she'd believe herself, and Harry and Ron would probably too. As long as you don't go back further than before you got the time turner, surely you'd assume that a future you came back to warn you about something that was about to happen?","Not to beat a dead horse, but can we discuss Time Turners?",1673462370

harrypotter,"I've read all the books multiple times and watched the movies too. But I just cannot sit through a re- watch of the film series. It's sooo boring.

I see so many posts of people saying that they go back to the movies to feel good, to feel at home, to be comforted. I don't feel that way.

I need at least a year between two watches of the series. For instance, last time I finished a HP movie marathon was 2 months ago and yesterday I went back to the sorcerer's stone and got bored very soon. I forced myself and kept watching till the ""you're a wizard, harry"" scene and then I just had to stop.

I've observed that over the years I've started to dislike the movies more and more.
The first two movies are good imo but the later parts - especially 4th(GTH Mike Newell),5th,6th- ugh!! They feel very badly adapted and have lost the charm for me.

I love the books and could easily go back to the 1st book right after finishing a reading marathon. But that's just not the case with the movies anymore. idk..

Anyone else feels this way ? or am I alone?

P.S. I am a LOTR fan as well. I've been a LOTR fan for many years. And I absolutely love the extended editions of it's movies.

harrypotter,"Considering the reception to the fandom to the recent rumors, regarding a possible reboot of the series, I was wondering which would be the best way to keep the Wizarding World going, not counting a reboot of the movies, nor a reboot as a TV series, which is one of the most common suggestions, but which also seems to be pretty divisise by a part of the fandom, which considers it's too early for a reboot.

Personally, I think Warner should do what they seem to be already testing with Hogwarts Legacy: use Hogwarts, but in a different context. If Hogwarts Legacy works, I can see them creating a TV series taking place in Hogwarts, possibly also taking place in a different time period. Maybe the first season could be during Hogwarts's foundation and start from there, with the founders, as the heads of their respective houses, helping Hogwarts studying deal with their struggles, while also dealing with their own struggles.

They could just call it ""Hogwarts"", or, if they want to make the fandom happier, maybe they could call it ""Hogwarts: A History"".

But that's just my opinion. What would you be more inclined to see?

And the dementors are essentially one hit kill unless you spend all your concentration defending against them with a patronus.  I think that the spiders would be able to take the focus of the fights away from the dementors, and the giants would have let both the dementors and spiders in the castle.

harrypotter,"11 January 2023 - In recent years, the wizarding world has seen a steady increase in international trade and commerce, but sources now suggest that this trend is slowing down.

The Ministry of Magic has reported a decrease in the number of import and export licenses issued for wizarding goods and services, indicating a downturn in international trade. This has caused concern among many in the wizarding community, as international trade has become a crucial aspect of the wizarding economy.

Businesses that rely heavily on international trade, such as the magical instrument industry and the potion-making industry, have reported a significant drop in profits. Many merchants have been forced to lay off workers and reduce production as a result of the decrease in demand for their products.

Experts attribute the slowdown in international trade to several factors, including increasing regulations and tariffs imposed by the Ministry of Magic, as well as tensions between different wizarding nations. Some have also pointed to the ongoing war in the Middle East, which has affected trade routes and made it more difficult for merchants to transport goods.

The Ministry of Magic has assured the wizarding community that they are taking steps to address the issue, but many businesses and individuals are calling for more drastic measures to be taken to boost international trade.

&gt;use the damage to his advantage: He would encase the torn portion —”

If we take that entirely at face value, things aren't looking very good for Tom's soul. 

Looking at the number of Inferi in the lake, then let's take 150 as the minimum he killed and 1000 as the maximum. Seems about fair. Then, *at best*, he'll have 151-1001 individual pieces of soul. But it's not quite so simple.

In order to find our real answer, we have to decide how a soul tears (though, in sincerity, I *soul-*ly doubt it's meant to be treated so mathematically). Since there's no way with each given murder to know the total number of murders in the future, there's no reason to split an even piece of each time. So likely no perfect 151-1001 part soul. 

If, each time, a chunk just comes off like a sandwich crumb, then he's probably got a bunch of tiny super mini soul bits floating about. Great to resurrect yourself with those.

But. If it's actually cutting off a half each time, and assuming that each half won't be spared future halving in the future, then after 150 murders he'll have 2\^150,  or seventy quattuordecillion (!!!), individual pieces of soul. 7•10\^46. And if it's 1000 murders, then it'll be in almost a centillion, or \~9•10\^302 different parts. Soooooooo yeah. Big numbers. Very big numbers.

That does seem to explain why his soul was so unstable he made a whole accidental Horcrux.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Some alternate scenarios: 

* Voldemort loses a half each time he makes a Horcrux, but murder alone doesn't split his soul in two. Then, he's only got 1/256th remaining.
* Voldemort plans ahead and manages to put about 1/7th in each intentional Horcrux. He still probably ends up splitting the final seventh with Harry, since he gave it up by accident, meaning he and Harry each get 1/14th.
* Peter Pettigrew, when resurrecting him, draws some substantial fraction off of all the Horcruxes, giving him actually a decent restart point.
* Voldemort's soul is no longer a single entity but a sickly buzzing hive of barely connected parts, which no horrible act is even able to damage more.

harrypotter,"Dobby, is practically everyone's favorite character, yet he really gets the short end of the stick in the films. It's like so annoying, and the real reason i could see why they cut him out of the following films we'll discuss, is because they really didn't know any better, or better yet didn't know he would become such a huge and important character later down the line. But is that actually true? By the time the GOF film came out, it was 2005, and the GOF, OOTP, and HBP book already released, and dobby is a prominent character there as well. And when 2007 came about, the books ended and only the OOTP film came out, so why couldn't they have included him in the films before? Is it because they think he's some useless character or something? It's stupid. 

**The Chamber Of Secrets**

Yes, his first appearance to the franchise, really doesn't stick out much. He really just like barely shows up in the film, just in the beginning, middle, and end. Not really much to say here, because even in the book like what does he do? The only thing that really sticks out, is his love of harry tbh. He's so devoted and loyal to him even though he's not even his master, they honestly seem like really good friends, but none of that is really translated in the films tbh. Harry just seems like he doesn't give 2 shits about dobby, and ofc this will become much more apparent later, but even here it feels hfbr3bf yk. 

I also want to talk about his design, and yeah it looks...ugly af. Like i get he's a house elf what more was i expecting, but his design just looks like a wrinkled nutsack tbh. And it's shame they don't have his round glassy tennis ball eyes or whatever. 

Lucius pretty much kills harry and the end of the film, and this is the last we see of dobby, until his eventual demise, but i don't care because he still shows up in the books.

**The Goblet Of Fire**

I remember a while back of something i saw on youtube i think, but it was an easter egg of the GOF film, and in a split second shot you could make it out dobby and winky, during the quidditch world cup scene. And it just makes it even worse why they didn't show up. And i think maybe that's why they didn't want to add dobby? Because they didn't want to have winky? Or something idk i'm really grasping at straws. And it's even more baffling because winky is a great character. Yeah, sure she's an alcoholic mess, but she's really like the driving force for hermione's S.P.E.W obsession and movement. And this scene really shows it.

 *“You may rest assured that she will be punished,” Mr. Crouch added coldly. “M-m-master . . .” Winky stammered, looking up at Mr. Crouch, her eyes brimming with tears. “M-m-master, p-p-please . . .” Mr. Crouch stared back, his face somehow sharpened, each line upon it more deeply etched. There was no pity in his gaze. “Winky has behaved tonight in a manner I would not have believed possible,” he said slowly. “I told her to remain in the tent. I told her to stay there while I went to sort out the trouble. And I find that she disobeyed me. This means clothes.” “No!” shrieked Winky, prostrating herself at Mr. Crouch’s feet. “No, master! Not clothes, not clothes!” Harry knew that the only way to turn a house-elf free was to present it with proper garments. It was pitiful to see the way Winky clutched at her tea towel as she sobbed over Mr. Crouch’s feet. “But she was frightened!” Hermione burst out angrily, glaring at Mr. Crouch. “Your elf ’s scared of heights, and those wizards in masks were levitating people! You can’t blame her for wanting to get out of their way!” Mr. Crouch took a step backward, freeing himself from contact with the elf, whom he was surveying as though she were something filthy and rotten that was contaminating his over-shined shoes. “I have no use for a house-elf who disobeys me,” he said coldly, looking over at Hermione. “I have no use for a servant who forgets what is due to her master, and to her master’s reputation.”*  

She plays such a huge part in the whole crouch storyline, which IMO is really where this book shines. And yes ik this is about dobby, but it feels weird to not at least mention her, because then again, it was because of him she even got a job. But in this book we really see the relationship of him and harry building stronger, especially with the gillyweed.

Okay listen...i get why they cut out him actually giving it, and having neville do it instead, because it made more sense...but it's not like the films made that shit up. That was his original plan in the first place, he wanted harry to ask neville about gillyweed but that failed so he used dobby instead...so why couldn't they just do that instead too? It's like it's the little things that make harry and dobby special yk, even him giving him the stupid sweater he made for him, that's just cute. And even just the fact that again he risked his neck just to help harry, is even better. 

**The Order Of The Phoenix**

Okay replacing dobby with neville last time you had a pass, doing it again nah that's taking it too far. It's like why? Just why? It's so stupid and leaves dobby doing nothing and not even show up in the entire film. And not even just the fact that he doesn't find the room of requirement, nah they take it a step further, and not have him warn harry about umbridge.

 *But he thought he knew — surely only one “she” could induce such fear in Dobby? The elf looked up at him, slightly cross-eyed, and mouthed wordlessly. “Umbridge?” asked Harry, horrified. Dobby nodded, then tried to bang his head off Harry’s knees; Harry held him at bay. “What about her? Dobby — she hasn’t found out about this — about us — about the D.A.?” He read the answer in the elf’s stricken face. His hands held fast by Harry, the elf tried to kick himself and fell to the floor. “Is she coming?” Harry asked quietly. Dobby let out a howl, and began beating his bare feet hard on the floor. “Yes, Harry Potter, yes!” Harry straightened up and looked around at the motionless, terrified people gazing at the thrashing elf. “WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?” Harry bellowed. “RUN!” They all pelted toward the exit at once, forming a scrum at the door, then people burst through; Harry could hear them sprinting along the corridors and hoped they had the sense not to try and make it all the way to their dormitories. It was only ten to nine, if they just took refuge in the library or the Owlery, which were both nearer — “Harry, come on!” shrieked Hermione from the center of the knot of people now fighting to get out. He scooped up Dobby, who was still attempting to do himself serious injury, and ran with the elf in his arms to join the back of the queue. “Dobby — this is an order — get back down to the kitchen with the other elves, and if she asks you whether you warned me, lie and say no!” said Harry. “And I forbid you to hurt yourself!” he added, dropping the elf as he made it over the threshold at last and slamming the door behind him. “Thank you, Harry Potter!” squeaked Dobby, and he streaked off.*  

This is even dumber because now in the film, the entire D.A gets in trouble, whereas in the book they all got off totally unharmed. Which even brings us to very next scene in the film, where they're in dumbledore's office and completely ruin that too. I'm sorry, i'm getting off track the OOTP film is the bane of my existence, and it ruined dobby so it's even worse now.

But oh wait, like GOF this film could't get enough of ruining just one house elf, so they ruined another one...kreacher. I love the fact that harry actually goes to kreacher and asks him if sirius betrayed him, and he doesn't look like a complete idiot for not actually going to check...UNLIKE IN THE FILM! WHERE HE IS. Kreacher is like the complete opposite of dobby, having no respect sirius and pretty much hating his guts. And i understand, he really was the living embodiment of everything he hated with his family's pureblood mania. And even his betrayal is such a crazy ass plot twist, and makes sirius dying even so much more gut-wrenching. And i know this about dobby, but it plays in here too, by removing the character it makes their death much less impactful. Hence, dobby in DH. His death feels unearned and downright cheap and pretty much useless, because all that build-up we had of him and harry's friendship growing and growing over the course of the series, is just completely gone. And at times it also makes him an idiot, like not asking kreacher in the fire about sirius in the film AND...

**The Half-Blood Prince**

Not telling dobby to spy on malfoy. It's literally right there dude, you're so close. Yes, it's not established he even works in hogwarts, but guess what aberforth still called him in malfoy manor, so idk. And i find it hilarious that this homeboy really beat the living hell out of kreacher, and broke some of his teeth because he was talking shit about harry, that's just dedication. 

And that's pretty much all he does for this book...so maybe i'll be lenient and i'll give the film a pass for him cutting him here.

**The Deathly Hallows**

But now reach the penultimate end of whatever idk. Because the films pull a complete 180 and actually include him in the film...YAY but not really. It just feels really rushed and like they're trying to cram in all the missed character moments we had from the books all into 1 scene and it just fails completely, rendering his death scene just completely butchered.

This is honestly one of the best death scenes of the entire series, and it's done beautifully in the book.

 *“Dobby — no — HELP!” Harry bellowed toward the cottage, toward the people moving there. “HELP!”  He did not know or care whether they were wizards or Muggles, friends or foes; all he cared about was that a dark stain was spreading across Dobby’s front, and that he had stretched out his thin arms to Harry with a look of supplication. Harry caught him and laid him sideways on the cool grass. “Dobby, no, don’t die, don’t die —” The elf’s eyes found him, and his lips trembled with the effort to form words. “Harry . . . Potter . . .” And then with a little shudder the elf became quite still, and his eyes were nothing more than great glassy orbs, sprinkled with light from the stars they could not see.* 

Deathly hallows is already a complete bonkers book, with deaths flying left and right and centre, yet dobby's one really just feels like it came out of nowhere and unexpected, and that really adds to the scene rather than take away. I still remember reading the book for one of the first times, and his death really hit me super hard. Like i was literally bawling my eyes out damn. And what's even sadder than him just dying is the scene with his funeral. “

*''There,” she said softly. “Now he could be sleeping.” Harry placed the elf into the grave, arranged his tiny limbs so that he might have been resting, then climbed out and gazed for the last time upon the little body. He forced himself not to break down as he remembered Dumbledore’s funeral, and the rows and rows of golden chairs, and the Minister of Magic in the front row, the recitation of Dumbledore’s achievements, the stateliness of the white marble tomb. He felt that Dobby deserved just as grand a funeral, and yet here the elf lay between bushes in a roughly dug hole. “I think we ought to say something,” piped up Luna. “I’ll go first, shall I?” And as everybody looked at her, she addressed the dead elf at the bottom of the grave. “Thank you so much, Dobby, for rescuing me from that cellar. It’s so unfair that you had to die, when you were so good and brave. I’ll always remember what you did for us. I hope you’re happy now.” She turned and looked expectantly at Ron, who cleared his throat and said in a thick voice, “Yeah . . . thanks, Dobby.” “Thanks,” muttered Dean. Harry swallowed. “Good-bye, Dobby,” he said. It was all he could manage, but Luna had said it all for him. Bill raised his wand, and the pile of earth beside the grave rose up into the air and fell neatly upon it, a small, reddish mound. “D’you mind if I stay here a moment?” he asked the others. They murmured words he did not catch; he felt gentle pats upon his back, and then they all traipsed back toward the cottage, leaving Harry alone beside the elf. He looked around: There were a number of large white stones, smoothed by the sea, marking the edge of the flower beds. He picked up one of the largest and laid it, pillowlike, over the place where Dobby’s head now rested. He then felt in his pocket for a wand. There were two in there. He had forgotten, lost track; he could not now remember whose wands these were; he seemed to remember wrenching them out of someone’s hand. He selected the shorter of the two, which felt friendlier in his hand, and pointed it at the rock. Slowly, under his murmured instruction, deep cuts appeared upon the rock’s surface. He knew that Hermione could have done it more neatly, and probably more quickly, but he wanted to mark the spot as he had wanted to dig the grave. When Harry stood up again, the stone read:* ***HERE LIES DOBBY, A FREE ELF.***  

Just the fact that he thought dobby deserved just as a grand funeral as dumbledore, really speaks to what i've been talking about this entire post, their friendship. That's what really matters, and that magic is really completely lost in the films. Even his last words don't feel earned at all in the films. In the books it's simple, it's just ''harry potter'', because that's all he needed to say, his actions spoke louder. Like him saving harry with the gillyweed, his present with the baubles he presented in the ROR, his crazy ass sweater he gave harry, warning him about umbridge, and even beating up kreacher because he talked shit about his boy, that's dobby, and all of that is lost in the films, and makes his death way less impactful. Both DH films always felt weird to me, in ways i couldn't really articulate, everything just felt, like less impactful and especially the death's. And i now i know why, it's not built up or set up. And that's the problem, you don't build off characters to just have them to die, you develop them first and then kill them, but it just felt the filmakers went the opposite way, and had the intent to kill him first, and didn't care about developing him because they just thought they were going to die in the end, so who cares. It's that level of carelessness that really shows in character's like dobby. And this happens all the time, just read this post again and replace dobby with sirius and it would pretty much be the same, or maybe even lupin too. But for now, it's dobby's turn for the spotlight. 

**In Conclusion**

I always feel like nobody really cared about dobby in the films tbh, like the only time he's actually mentioned is just like how it's better than neville gave him the gillyweed or whatever. But i feel like even in the films too, they really just didn't care about him. And it's not like he's some underrated nothing character, no he's prominent enough to get killed off spectacularly and plays major roles in the last few books. He doesn't get the respect he really deserves man, he honestly deserved so much better. And kreacher too man my god, how come he didn't show up in the end of the battle of hogwarts, such a missed opportunity. But then again, pretty much everything that has to do with dobby is a missed opportunity in the films. Also people who say kreacher had a better character arc than dobby? Like what was dobby's character arc? Huh? He loved harry through and through and really didn't change that much as a character. Whereas kreacher actually changed drastically and went from just hating harry's guts to serving faithfully and lovingly. Not really even related that much, but i just like it had to be said.",Dobby Really Deserved Better In The Films.,1673391091

I thought he was the best of the three in the first couple of movies (“why can’t we follow the butterflies?” cracks me up) and starting with PoA it was about even. Ron was dealt dirty in the movies though and I attribute this to the scriptwriter. 

Harry i think is pretty close to the book version minus the sarcastic quips that were in the book.  We kind of got this in in Half Blood Prince with the Felix Felicis sequence but overall he’s more of a straight man, stereotypical hero character.

For Hermione I think the issue is that the movies made her feel more like Harry’s best friend than Ron did, which again I attribute to the scriptwriter. She also comes across to me as more bossy in the movies than in the books and I don’t know if it’s due to the script or Emma Watson’s direction.

harrypotter,"It's not exactly a secret that Warner Bros has seen better days. Amid a series of massive corporate reshufflings, and a string of unexpected box office flops, WB has made some HUGE decisions in the last year or so. 

While most of the attention has been put on DC, the Wizarding World franchise has also gone through some changes. Most namely, the cancellation of the Fantastic Beasts franchise. Secrets of Dumbledore is at least for now, the last Wizarding World movie, with the last two Fantastic Beasts movies no longer in production. 

However, this begs the question: What can WB do to make this a profitable film franchise again? Well, here is how I think they should go about it. 

**Albus Potter and the Cursed Child**

Now it's not exactly a secret that this project has been in consideration for some time now, however I think it would be the best direction to go. At least for right now. 

While the play was not very good at all (at least IMO), I think that a movie could fix some of the problems. 

I'd go with an entirely new villain, who isn't related to Voldemort or Bellatrix. Someone looking to maybe take the best aspects of Grindelwald and Voldemort and try to accomplish what they couldn't. Maybe, this new villain could be the same age as Albus and Scorpius, allowing for a new dynamic that we haven't seen before. A Wizarding World villain that's the same age as the main characters. 

I would most likely eliminate the time travel plotline, since I think that the time-turners should remain a rare item that's almost never seen. Maybe this idea could be explored in the future, but for a first movie, it's just not a good idea at all. 

Also, this is a no-brainer for me, but I'd bring back the original actors from the first 8 films to play their older selves. And yes, this does include Emma Watson, since it wouldn't make sense for Hermione to be a different race in this franchise. 

This could be the first in a new series of films, or it could be a one-and-done. But after the Fantastic Beasts franchise failed to appeal to casual audiences (and even hardcore fans), I think a big title like this would be the best way to bring attention back to this franchise. Just do what Disney did with Star Wars but do it better than they did. 

**The Marauders**

I'd make this the first TV show of the franchise, following a young James Potter, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew, and their various misadventures at Hogwarts. We could also see a lot of other younger versions of characters, such as Snape, Lily, Lucius, Bellatrix, Narcissa and Regulus. Not to mention all of the professors. 

This could be a much lower stakes show, simply focusing on relationship drama, teen angst and anxiety, and the meaning of friendship. However, we could also see the beginning of the Death Eaters and see a transition into the first Wizarding War against Voldemort. Ideally, I'd have the show end with Voldemort being defeated in Godric's Hollow, Lily and James being killed and Sirius being arrested. 

**The Founders**

This would either be a movie or a mini-series, and would follow the four founders of Hogwarts, and their early struggles with running the school. We'd see how they all first came together, how various aspects of the school were decided, and the eventual falling out between Salazar Slytherin and the rest of the founders. 

If this movie/series is a success, then I would leverage the popularity of it, to make a sequel based on the founding of Ilvermorny in America. I don't think it would be fair to completely ditch the American side of this world, just because of Fantastic Beasts' failure. Speaking of:

**Dumbledore and Grindelwald**

This trilogy would COMPLETELY retcon the Fantastic Beasts' trilogy out of existence and give us the version of this story that we should've gotten in the first place. We get to see Dumbledore's tough upbringing, his relationship/friendship with Grindelwald, and the eventual duel between them and Aberforth that would cost Aurelia her life. 

The second movie would be about Albus travelling the world and making a name for himself, eschewing the naive and bitter personality he would've had in the first film. Grindelwald would meanwhile be building his own band of supporters.

The third film would finally see the famous duel between the pair, ending with Dumbledore detaining his former love and sending him to Azkaban where Voldemort would later find him in Deathly Hallows Part 2.

* **Young Voldemort movie/show**
* Squib project (about finding purpose despite not being able to use magic)

harrypotter,I get it that sometimes when students receive an award in school competitions or so they donate it to the school to be exposed in the school's museum or trophy room. But in this particular case - even if it was all a scam - Tom Riddle received that award for himself for identifying the alleged monster of Slytherin and chasing it away and thus 'rescuing' Hogwarts from it. So then why wasn't that award specifically given to Tom? It had no academic value but rather showed an alleged act of bravery done by Tom to save the school.,Why was Tom Riddle's award for special services brought to the school kept in the Hogwarts' trophy room instead of being given to him?,1673382327
harrypotter,"I, personally, feel that Snape and Lily knowing each other was random and just pulled out randomly. I think Rowling could have added a few small hints throughout the books for rereads as she did for the other books' plot twists. It just kind of surprised me when she did not build up to such a huge reveal.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, so now for where I think she could have added a hint. In OotP, Draco Malfoy insults Harry's mother causing Harry to be banned from quidditch by Umbridge. 

\&gt;“Or perhaps,” said Malfoy, leering as he backed away, “you can remember what your mother’s house stank like, Potter, and Weasley’s pigsty reminds you of it —”

I think it would have been cool if Snape was either on the field and reacted after Harry attacked Malfoy of course so the story could continue. Maybe Snape did not stop Malfoy from getting hurt like Harry expected and just stared with a sneer.  Or maybe instead of Snape being on the field,  McGonagall told Snape when Snape asked and Snape gave Malfoy detention. Of course, the book would not dwell on this and it would be one line like ""Snape gave Malfoy a week's detention for inciting a fight to Harry's surprise.""",Where do you think J.K. Rowling could have hinted at Lily and Snape's friendship?,1673381190
harrypotter," I like Mr. Weasley not trying to fight Lucius at Flourish and Blotts in the COS movie.

The book scene doesn't paint him in a bad light-he is defending his family and Hermoine after all.

However, the movie version fits his character much more: He sets a good example to the kids by defending his family with words, not violence.

Mark Williams is fantastic in this scene. When Lucius says, ""associating with Muggles"" he initially looks like he's about to strike Malfoy, but he quickly cools off, smiling at the kids as if assuring them 'The Malfoy's aren't worth it.'",Which scenes from movies do you prefer from the books?,1673380851
harrypotter,"So, when rereading the series I found the below text: 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;

They found an unpleasant-looking silver instrument, something like a many-legged pair of tweezers, which scuttled up Harry’s arm like a spider when he picked it up, and attempted to puncture his skin. Sirius seized it and smashed it with a heavy book entitled Nature’s Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy. There was a musical box that emitted a faintly sinister, tinkling tune when wound, and they all found themselves becoming curiously weak and sleepy, until Ginny had the sense to slam the lid shut; a heavy locket that none of them could open; a number of ancient seals; and, in a dusty box, an Order of Merlin, First Class, that had been awarded to Sirius’s grandfather for services to the Ministry.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

harrypotter,"I know a lot of people probably rank Malfoy's complicity in Dumbledore's death as the worst incident, but for some reason, I could never get over Malfoy's pretense that Buckbeak seriously injured him.  Malfoy was so happy that Buckbeak was going to be executed.  The boy was just plain evil.",Which incident makes you hate Malfoy the most?,1673379054
harrypotter,"I've seen the play in San Francisco and read the script. The story is fantastic. It had been 19 years since the Second War. In 19 years, muggles had invented computers that work as phones that fit in our pockets, self-driving cars, etc etc. In 19 years, it's entirely feasible that Time-Turners were reinvented and improved in the wizarding world. Draco is the inventor and despite his character arc in the harry potter stories, we never knew his academic achievements. I can see him being passionate about time travel because he has so many regrets from the past. Hermione is Minister for Magic, of course. Ron works with George at WWW fitting his character. Harry is an Auror, of course. Each of them has grown to become adults in those 19 years, becoming parents, and achieving/giving up on their dreams. They have matured and changed. Most of the opinions hating on the cursed child involve it being ""fan fiction"", the world not following the ""rules"" of the harry potter stories (19 years prior...), and that the characters have changed from their core beliefs (19 years prior...)

It is not ""fan fiction"", it's canon. The author of the story decided that this story was the one that she wanted to include in the canon of the story. It is written by a playwright rather than a young adult fantasy writer. So many of the qualms about the writing or story should simply be because you wanted something different to happen. If Rowling had been the original writer, you would say it was fantastic. The harry potter series is not flawless, there are numerous continuity issues within it regarding the ""rules"" of the wizarding world and the personality of the characters, and she completely caters to the audience she is writing for in the last book, but you do not call that ""fan-fiction"" because she was the writer. 

From 18 years old to 37 years old, most, if not all, people change, drastically. Wisdom is a real thing that occurs over time and each of these characters shows that the way they think is different from being a child. Harry's relationship with Albus is severely strained as many teenager/parent relationships are because the teenager is becoming their own person. 

Delphi being the daughter of Voldemort and Bellatrix is another point of contention. For some reason, people on this subreddit think that Voldemort is incapable or uninterested in sex because it was never mentioned in the harry potter series. Voldemort is a power-crazed dictator who would do anything to survive. He was a psychopath incapable of love or affection. But it is naive to think that sex is attached to love or affection. Sex is a biological function along with any cultural meaning that has been attached to it. Voldemort having sex with Bellatrix is entirely possible, and I would argue is accurate of his character. Bellatrix wanting to have the child of the person she was obsessed with is also a part of her character. It would increase her infamy playing into her ego as the only person to be close enough to the dark lord to have his child. Delphi grew up the same as Harry did. Both parents' true identities were hidden from her, growing up in a house with someone that did not like her, knowing parseltongue, and discovering who she truly was and the prophecy about her in her early teens.

harrypotter,"I don't mean as in killing him. He wouldn't know about the Horcuxes, but he would probably be able to kill his body, making Voldemort the sort of Ghost, that he was in the first couple of books. I asume he would win, due to multiple factors.

- Grindelwald relied on his skills alone, while Voldemort simply relied on his immortality. Voldemort was very skilled, but he mostly picked enemies much weaker than himself, and tried to avoid his one equally matched wizard (Dumbledore) at all cost. Also Grindelwald managed to subdue the Elder wand, even though he only stole it, while Voldemort didn't.

-Grindelwalds followers were actually loyal to him. They respected him. Only a few Death eaters followed Voldemort out of Loyalty. Most of them followed him, out of fear. That makes Grindelwalds followers much more willing to risk their lives for him, than Voldemorts followers.

-Grindelwald had a much bigger sphere of Influence. He controlled almost all of Europe, while Voldemort was just barrely able to hold Brittain, and failed to take down a school.",Grindelwald at his prime would have probably won against Voldemort at his prime,1673376201

harrypotter,"I can't imagine this has never been posted before, but I haven't seen it if it has. But I just love the idea of a Harry and Dudley reunion down the road. 

After the final interaction with the Dursleys, I think we can all agree that Dudley partially redeemed himself. No, it doesn't alleviate all of the mistreatment of Harry over the years alongside Vernon and Petunia. But... He was still a kid when he was extra terrible to Harry and did seem to grow quite a bit after the dementor attack. I'm sure we all were terrible to some degree when we were young, but realizing this and changing for the better (hopefully) is part of growing up, and Dudley seemed to gain some perspective the following couple of years. 

So that brings me to the point of this post: after the amicable farewell between Harry and Dudley in DH, I like to think that the two reunited at some point in the future and even maybe became fond of each other, almost as if they were family... 

I saw a while back a fan fic post about the older crew showing up for Christmas at the Burrow from Mrs. Weasley's loving perspective. In that post, Kreacher was present, indicting a reunion with Harry after the Battle and a positive relationship forming out of an originally negative one. I'd love to see something similar with Harry and Dudley. I know he would probably never want to see Vernon and Petunia again, and vice versa, but I think that Harry and Dudley meeting up at some point and even having children that grew up knowing their cousins on that side of the family would be cool. Even if it was just something short like the above-mentioned fan fic. 

And if we really wanted to break that thang open, what if Dudley had a kid who wound up being a witch or wizard?? I mean... Dudley is related to the Potter side by blood via Lily, so it could definitely happen. I think a storyline where not only do we see the Harry/Dudley relationship develop, but we also see Dudley learning how to deal with being the parent of a wizard after the traumas and upbringing he experienced as a young boy. 

I'm not thinking a drawn out series or anything, just a fun little something something like the Christmas Burrow story. I don't know, maybe there isn't as much to it as I'm thinking, but I think there is some cool/fun potential there.",Dudley reunion?,1673375774

harrypotter,"Now, let me say this first- I too think the books are better. But I also think that this is the case with most adaptations. People have to remember- movies are far more limited in what they can show or do, and with those boundaries, I thought the movies were about as solid as they could've been. They had to be very particular about what they could include, and what they had to omit. Looking back, it's kind of a miracle how they weren't terrible with all the challenges they were facing. Most book to tv show adaptations don't even do as good a job of adapting the source material like the movies did (The Wheel of Time, for example)

Personally, the movies were incredibly successful in capturing the feeling of the books. I also like how the movies shift in tone similar to books as they go on. That might seem easy on the surface, but it's not.

harrypotter,"It comes as no surprise that there is a prejudice between the Wizarding World, and also Muggles. But can you believe that such prejudice could be created by Hogwarts itself? 

Today we're going to look at this topic with another tongue and cheek humor. Lets do this! 

First off we should know that the Wizarding World exist in secret due to the persecutions faced by them during the Middle Ages, and this was when Muggles were feeling that religious fever so to speak. But the interesting thing is as much as Hogwarts was founded to teach the wizarding arts. Salazar Slytherin the founder of House Slytherin wanted Hogwarts to be a school of pure born practitioners to be allowed to practice magic. He even took Godric Gryffindor's tathered hat to create, you guessed it.....The Sorting Hat to of course place prospective students into such houses.

So early on Sly Salazar schemed a tradition that is still used today, even it those intentions are to put it in a better term, ""good"". While later of course Daddy Salazar would leave Hogwarts with intentions of his own and disappear. He would leave behind The Chamber of Secrets for which had a Basalisk to be unleashed to kill off Muggle raised and Half Bloods to make way for those dastardly pure bloods like them annoying Malfoys. 

""But Ferrum you say, Hogwarts was a sanctuary for the Wizards and Witches, it's not that bad.""

While this might be true, even evil is a road paved with good intentions. Keep in mind that while Dumbledore did in fact eventually go on to become headmaster at Hogwarts. Before his time there, as revealed in the Fantastic Beast stories, and Deathly Hallows, him and Grindelwald shared a deep connection to look for those dark relics so they too could become masters of death. While Dumbledore might have wanted nothing but good intentions, his blind devotion to Grindelwald would have him follow such a dark path, making an unbreakable oath, and eventually cause him to duel Grindelwald for the fated Elder Wand. So while he sought to redeem himself, the hunger for power was always there.

Finally lets talk about the deeper secret, The Founding Houses, while competition is all in good fun and humor? Much animosity has always flourished between the Houses. Especially Gryffindor and Slytherin. Examples can be found between James Potter and Snape over Lily. Then you also have Harry and Draco, though in time they do put their differences aside to face Voldemort and the Death Eaters too. The point is rivalry runs deep, and while competition is big for the House Cup. Much of that rivalry still can carry over after the years at Hogwarts. 

So it begs for one to wonder, does Hogwarts and the Houses help influence the Wizarding World? Or consume it from within?

harrypotter,"In HBP after Harry's skull was cracked by McLaggen's bludger, he calls Kreacher to ask him to tail Malfoy. When Harry heard the signature crack of apparition, he saw two elves fighting. Kreacher, AND Dobby.

My question: How did Dobby know that Kreacher was apparating to Harry, and how the hell did he start fighting him mid-apparation? I thought that apparition was near instantaneous, and that no one could apparate next to you unless intentionally using side-along apparition.

Bonus question: In the same scene, Kreacher was insulting Harry, saying that he was friends with blood-traitors and whatnot. This, however contradicts Dobby.

harrypotter,"I basically came here to see if anyone else feels this way. As a kid I watched all the Harry Potter movies when they came out, starting from Prizoner of Azkaban (wasn't born before Chamber  of Secrets 💀),  and rematched them countless times at home with my family, especially my mum and my sister. 

I remember reenacting scenes with my sister when we were younger, and even reading the first 3 books as a kid too. Even though I didn't read all of the books, I can confidently say that Harry Potter has been a major part of my life and has always brought joy to me and my family.

Now that I'm older and me and my family have new lives and jobs obviously Harry Potter nights have become much less frequent. We still talk about them from time to time and still love the films but don't watch them nearly as much. 

Now on the rare occasion when I watch a movie, watch a clip of a scene on YouTube from one of the movies, or even listen to some of the scores, I get overwhelmed with emotion and nostalgia and start crying. I miss those moments of acting out scenes when I was younger and waiting for the new movies to come out, Harry Potter brought so much happiness to my life and still does to this day of course.

First one - maybe a bit of a stretch but Hagrid illegally uses his wand to curse Dudley (he even tells Harry not to mention the incident to anyone) after which they go together to Gringotts where the Philosopher's Stone

Second one - Dobby comes to warn Harry about the Chamber of Secrets plot and tell him not to go to Hogwarts. Because Harry refuses, Dobby levitates the cake which prompts the Ministry to send him a warning letter

Third one - Harry runs away from the Dursleys after blowing his aunt and runs into Sirius/Padfoot

Fourth one - Harry almost gets attacked by Ministry employees because someone used his wand to cast the Dark Mark. We later learn that this was Crouch Jr who is working to resurrect Voldemort

Fifth one - Dementors in Little Whinging prompt Harry to cast a Patronus which sets up the conflict between Harry and the Ministry throughout the book

Sixth one - This one is a little bit reversed. Dumbledore comes to pick up Harry to find Slughorn and tells him to have his wand out ready in case but tells him not to worry because he (Harry) is with him (Dumbledore) and then takes Harry on side-along apparition. At the end Dumbledore tells Harry that he is not worried because he is with him and Harry illegally (as he does not yet have an apparition license) takes Dumbledore back to Hogsmeade via side-along apparition

Seventh one - Harry performs a bunch of spells during the battle of the seven Potters despite being underage, but the biggest one is Harry's wand attacking Voldemort, which prompts Voldemort to go on his quest for the Elder Wand

harrypotter,"Also known as Darth Wannabe.

More to the point, I'm referring to a certain minor character from Jim Butcher's famous book series, The Dresden Files, introduced in the short story ""Day Off"" in the compilation book ""Side Jobs"" as the 'antagonist' of what's one of the funniest moment in the entire franchise. And I wanted to know what you think of both this particular story and the series as a whole, since the subject matter is more or less the same and there are many references to Harry Potter in it.

Why, exactly, am I posting this? To elaborate: That series deals with wizards, monsters and magic on a large scale, taking inspiration from all sorts of mythologies and folk stories and even urban legends in very creative ways while still finding a way to be accurate to the source material. And among the hordes of characters inspired by creatures of legend and mythical characters, we have a **very** minor magic talent who Harry Dresden, the main character, derides as a poser and threatens with a revolver.

Especifically, 'Darth Wannabe' is a young ""magic practitioner"" leading his own troupe of Ringwraith reject to get back at Dresden, the eponymous protagonist (Who actually got his name from Houdini, not Potter), 'cause he undid a ""curse"" he cast (Something so minor it was unmade with just some reiki). He tries to be impressive and dramatic, but Dresden calls him and his friends a bunch of tryhards who wears a lot of black, drive a van with goat skulls and inverted crosses painted on the sides and, of course, wear Slytherin scarves and have Dark Marks tattooed on their arms; he even tells them that while he liked the movies, you don't see them going *that* far.

Then, when they challenge to a duel, he tells the Dim Lord and his flying monkeys that if they want to see magic then he can show them some magic. Not by actually casting a spell ('Cause that'd be overkill against those kids), but making the windows on their van disappear with some good ol' gunshots.

Now that you got some context, tell me: If you know of this series, what do you think of it in general and/or compared to this series? I'm sure that you ought to at least have an opinion on stuff like wizardry being nigh completely self-taught, magic having no language for its spellcasting and the presence of characters like The Fair Folk, vampires that are more like their myths portrayed than what modern media says they are, full-blown gods and demons and even belief systems integrated into magic as a whole.

And if you don't, what do you think of this story? And no, the author wasn't actually taking cheap shots at Harry Potter or anything of the sort (And neither am I, for that matter). It's just that, since wizards are more integrated to modern-day civilization compared to wizarding society (Which says a lot, since Dresden wizards can and do live for hundreds of years if given the chance), there HAD to be practitioners of some sort who thought that being a Death Eater would be a good idea. lol",The Dim Lord,1673330685

harrypotter,"(When I say unrealistic, of course, I mean within the logic of this fantasy world)

I was 18 I think when I read The Order of The Phoenix for the first time and one thing I always found 'odd' was how easily they enter the Ministry of Magic without no one seeing them!

I mean, in the muggle world we have from more basic security systems to more complex and hard to crack ones. 
Cameras, security guards, locks, alarms, etc. And for a public building like that, I expected good security.

Of course, they wouldn't be ""cameras"" there,  but not guard? no magic detectors or alarms? maybe I was expecting some equivalent to our security system somehow. 

Am I the only one who thought this was kinda odd?

harrypotter,"Quick note: this O.C. would be around at least 50-100 years after the events of Harry Potter. 

So I know most of the time, (it feels like) when people make an original character it's a student. but I had an idea for a teacher. This Teacher would teach Care of Magical Creatures and is a Half-Giant and Werewolf. But unlike every other Werewolf he is the first one who can fully control himself. Meaning if for some reason they needed to do a class at night during a full moon. He would be able to 100% no issue. (Just might get a tail wag when you answer correctly)

**Looks:** But Let's see if I can describe him well enough for you to picture them. I want to say he is about 9 feet in height, and very very muscular. I guess think of something between Hulk and Professor Hulk. Black hair in the style of a mohawk, reminiscent to a viking style. And of course he's just hairy all over thanks to the werewolf in him. Has lots of faded tattoos that look like they could be 1, very very detailed and it's just hard to tell now. OR they were just always a mess. A beard in between Hagrids and Dumbledore but tied into one braid. He has one Blue eye and one fully white eye with a nice scar going from the top of that eyebrow to his upper lip, (with a few other scars over his body) and his K9 teeth are always a bit bigger, even when not a werewolf. 

**Clothing**: For clothing he would wear just a harness on around his torso during the hot months were he would have bags attached to keep everything he needs. During the winter months he wears a normal shirt with the sleeves (most of the time) ripped off. 1-3 belts at all time depending on what he needs with him. For bottoms you can see him in some just normal pants, sometimes a fur-like kilt or one year a student got him a pair of super nice Jeans which he only wears if he is going to Hogsmead or on the weekends.

**Personality**: For being so ""rugged"" He takes great care of himself. making sure he never smells (students and teachers say he smells like firewood, a tiny bit of musk with a hint of vanilla. His Voice is deep and with a guttural growl to it. to the point he can scare people if he is not careful. He also knows signed language and teaches it to students who want to learn. to put his personality in a very blunt text. ""Looks like they can kill you, is a cinnamon roll. It's hard to get him upset but you can tell when that happens because he starts to stutter.

**Magical / Abilities:** Despite being a werewolf/half-gaint he is well versed in magic. Seemingly because of all the negative stereotypes put on him, He worked that much harder to overcome them and show people what he is capable of. He is even able to do wandless and wordless magic (though of course not nearly as strong) and can even block a few spells with himself alone. (Remember they needed to hit Hagrid with 4 stun spells before it did anything to him.) While in his werewolf form he is of course much stronger and faster but can't use magic. 

**Weaknesses:** While he works very hard to make sure he comes off nice and approachable some days it can be harder then others. Due to his size and voice he can be scary. to the point normally 1st years avoid him at all costs until a older student or teacher comes in and changes that. As stated before when he gets upset he starts to stutter, and goes until he looses his temper (which is extremely rare) and when that happens he turns into a crying mess. Also While is able to control himself, he knows at one point his werewolf instincts might be to much and that scares him. He is also known to be a bit to confident. Once having to be talked out of being hit with a killing curse because as he put it ""My pecs are so big it would bounce right off"" But that only happens after a few hours of drinking.

**Fun Facts**  
1. He ""owns"" 3 wands. His own and his Mothers, and his grandfathers.  
2. All Wands are inside one wand that is more like a staff to normal people. He rarely uses it however. More or less using ""wandless magic""  
3. His own ""personal"" wand was a 20 inch blackthorn with a dragon heartstring core.  
4. He was in  Gryffindor, but almost was put in Hufflepuff. The shorting hat took a bit trying to choose  
5. He was in the top 10 of his class  
6. Tried to play quidditch but brooms really cant hold that much weight  
7.  Hagrid is a hero to him  
8. He loves to apperate  
9. He wants to try and master fiendfyre but is to nervous to do so.  
10. Before coming teacher he was an Auror.  
11. One time while eating breakfast a bad wizard hit him with a curico curse. He finished his breakfast then calmly walked over to the gun before punching him out cold. Thats one of his more favorite rumors.  
12. During the summer months he takes a bath in the lake. Just be careful going out around midnight.  
13. He lives pretty much in the same spot where Hagrid lived. However his hut is bigger and has more of a ""castle light house"" feel to it.  
14. He is pansexual and has been known to be the ""handsome teacher"" by students and teachers. However if you say anything he turns beat red.  
15. He tries to help in the kitchen, but due to his size really can't and mostly annoys the house elves.  
17.  He swears... a lot  
18. He has a sister (fully human wizard) who works in the M.O.M. Her son goes to Hogwarts.  
19. In between Hogwarts and being an Auror he worked in a more ""adult"" field  
20. He is a candidates to one day become headmaster   
21. He LOVES LOVES LOVES to sing. However he sounds worse then mermaids out of the water.

harrypotter,"Hermione most likely felt insecure about herself in her own way, although not showing it. She most likely felt she was not attractive enough, not funny enough and simply not Ron's tempo. This might be one reason why she was so mad at Fleur all the time. She scowled when she kissed Ron, and was thoroughly foul to Fleur when she stayed at the Burrow. Because Fleur was a born beauty to male eyes from her genes alone. Having been mocked look-wise before, she probably felt that Ron would never choose her. And the fact that she was inherently nerdy while Ron obviously seemed to prefer hanging with more laid-back, outwardly funny and joking styled kids more (not that he didn't like Hermione being around him) probably didn't help.

As for Ron, it's obvious why he was insecure. Krum and Potter. Both of them famous throughout countries. One for being an amazing Quidditch player. One for hoodwinking the dark lord almost every year since he attended Hogwarts, and beating him as a boy. Both were extremely popular and liked by girls (Harry was only really liked after he did something cool, like prove he was right which in the eyes of girls, made him some masculine tough god who was strong and resilient). And, as Hermione's other best friend, both were on equal terms with Hermione, so he wouldn't really have a head start on her if it became a race to see who could charm her.

So in the end, both were just so blinded by the negative mindset of ""oh, they're gonna want someone else"" that they couldn't realize that the ""competition"" they had wasn't even real. Krum was more of a friend/experimental relationship than a long-term partner. Harry showed no signs of romantic affection for Hermione and likewise. And Fleur was more of eye-candy to Ron than someone he'd actually date in the future. Both actually liked each other, but couldn't even see it.",I thoroughly enjoyed how Ron and Hermione always liked each other but were too insecure and jealous to see it,1673324332

harrypotter,"Currently rereading the books after having only read them when I was very young, and something has become glaringly obvious; Harry Potter is a stupid child who is too proud for his own good. 

It’s obvious that it’s because he is young and stupid, thinking he always knows right because that’s what teenagers do. But because the movies follow an actor who ages 2-3 years between each movie that only has a 1 year gap, it feels like Harry is more mature in the 4th movie onwards. Radcliffe also acts older in his delivery and I can’t help but feel like they probably wrote the movies that way to make him sound more his own age. 

It’s not until you read the book when you realize that Harry Potter is painfully young. So young that I’ve been yelling in my head about things that happen in the 4th and 5th books simply because if he just wasn’t such a proud little brat, things would be so much easier for everyone. He could tell the truth, speak, and ask questions, but having watched the movies for so long, I’ve forgotten how young he is and how undeveloped that makes his brain. Hermione acts like the only sane person in a group of idiots, being the only voice of reason for a grown up reader which is a nice way to grasp some sense of sanity when I’m reading a young teen make bafflingly accurate decisions for someone his age.","It’s very easy to forget how young Harry is supposed to be in the movies, but NOT in the books",1673318875

harrypotter,"As many of you know, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child recently made its return to major theatre areas around the world. This new version of the play was only one part as opposed to two, cut around 1.5 hours worth of story, and features a new love story. I never saw the original version of the play, but I did read the script... and like a lot of people, I truly hated most of what I read. The characterizations of everyone were terrible, the constant usage of nostalgia felt off-putting, and the idea that Cedric Diggory was an important-enough character to warrant the entire ""eighth story"" in the HP being about him was just so weird. I didn't have any plans to see this on the stage and thought that was the end.

But this month, a family member of mine, who's a big fan of Harry Potter, got tickets to see this new version of the story. I was invited to watch it as well, so I attended the show in Toronto. I said to myself, even though I didn't like the script, I wanted to keep an open mind about what I was about to watch. Even with my problems with the story, I was intrigued by how the crew would pull off the production/magic stuff. 

I sat in my seat, the lights went down, and for 3 hours and 20 minutes, I was... incredibly disappointed. This story just does not work. In every sense of it, this story falters completely. The pacing is terrible, the dialogue is atrocious, Harry Potter is an absolutely terrible father despite nothing in the previous stories pointing to this becoming a possibility, most female characters are shafted completely then reappear randomly (Ginny, Rose, and even Hermoine), Ron gets nothing to do, Delphi is without-a-doubt the worst villain in the franchise, and the usage of Voldemort, Snape, and Cedric had my rolling my eyes. Somehow, the show felt jarringly fast and incredibly slow at the same time. In order to save time from the previous version, the first 20 minutes feel like an F1 race on steroids before coming to a screeching halt to actually set up the story, which again, is so boring and pretty confusing to keep up with. 

The saving grace of this new version is Albus and Scorpius' love story, which is a new addition. Despite not getting nearly enough time to actually explore their relationship, they were just adorable together, but nothing more. Honestly, if you do without all the bigger Harry Potter stuff, this story between the two young men would be a fairly standard, and enjoyable rom-com. But no, we have to get a story about Harry constantly going after Albus and Albus acting like the worst teenager to ever exist. 

I don't know if it's Jack Thorne, Rowling, or whoever else was involved in the writing of both versions of this story, but it's just awful. This should've probably been a movie to begin with, as then they could at least pull this thing off visually, but even then, after reading the script, I'd say kill it with fire. 

The actual production of the play was solid, with the crew using pretty cool optical illusions and practical effects to pull off the magic of the universe. But after a while, you'll find yourself wondering about how something would've and could've looked better if this was just a movie or TV show. There are just certain things in the HP universe that don't work on stage... mainly, WIZARD SPELLS. 

I'm all for supporting stage productions, but this one is just bad. I guess it's a saving grace that I saw the 3-hour version instead of the 5... because if I almost fell asleep during the Toronto production, who knows what would've happened in the London production. 

And just one more thing... none of this has anything to do with the cast. If any of you come across this post, know that none of you are the problem with this show and you all did a fine job. The writing is not nearly up to par with your acting skills.",I recently watched the revised version of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child and I have a lot of thoughts...,1673309785

Now as many people have said a tv series would be the perfect way to go about it and be able to be more faithful to the books. My biggest worry however is will the people who work on a potential series be passionate about making a faithful adaptation of these stories because I could totally see them wanting to put their own stamp on the series and make a lot of unnecessary changes to make it completely different from the books and movies.

harrypotter,"Magical evolution theory suggests that given what we know about the magical world, it is likely if not inevitable that the magical world will engulf the muggle world. The main points I will use to prove this will be population, politics and human nature because at the end of the day wizards are human too.


To start with we know that the population of witches and wizards is low during the events of the books. After dealing with the magical wars, two by voldemort and one grindlewald, there is likely to be a baby boom just like with our world after world war 2. Because of the acceptance of muggle born witch and wizards into wizarding society the population will soon ovwrtake muggles. We don't know the rates at which these people are born but given how many appear in the books I think it is fair to say the numbers are significant and only going to rise. 

An argument against this is the birth of squibs or non magical people born to magical family's. However I would argue that there is clear evidence that these people are likely to stay in the wizarding world. Filch is evidence that squibs are not kicked out of society, given how prejudiced the wizarding community is shown to be I'm sure that most squibs are treated as second class citizens, but I would say they are still more likely to stay in the wizarding world this I'd because they are not likely to leave to the almost alien muggle world. Arthur Weasley who is meant to work in the field of muggles is fascinated by simply things like the underground escalator and a rubber duck. The average wizard is going to be terrified at the idea of joining the muggle world. I would also say that life for squibs in the wizarding world is likely to get better again proved by Flitch working at one of the most prestigious wizarding school in the world. We are also shown that the younger generations are much more progressive when it comes to non magical people showing again that life will improve as the years pass. Plus there is the improvement to life that comes with living inside a magical world even without magic, bewitched items to make life easier would surely make even people without magic want to stay. 

Another point against my theory is that the magical world is just more dangerous, so the numbers of population will not grow. Jobs like inventing magic potions and caring for dangerous magical creatures and plants. But to this I would say these jobs are more likely to be few and far between rather than the norm. The magical world must have stores, restaurants and business of all kinds. Just like in the muggle world most jobs are likely to be safe. Even with the dangous jobs it is clear that health care in the wizarding world is much better than the muggle with people living much longer and being healed from most injuries and illnesses. 

Now if you accept my point that the population will rise through the decades then I believe this would bring in many changes for the wizarding world namely lack of jobs. With magic the jobsof ten people can be done with one spell and with better health care and easy work, just casing spells the age and amount of people retiring is like to go down substantially. This will make more witches and wizards poorer and dangling on the poverty line. Also as the population grows space will come at a premium. We have seen that magic can do strange things with space (tent at quidditch world cup) but even with this there is only so much space and so much money to buy the available space to go around. This will push poor and poorer witches and wizards closer and closer to the muggle world with poor people almost rubbing shoulders with muggles. 

I  belive this will all come to a head with poor witch's and wizards being becoming poorer and angrier and angrier. I belive it wouldn't take much, a charismatic smooth talking dark witch or wizard, to use this unrest. They could to work their way up the political system to be voted minister of magic. They could then use this position with the backing of the people to start a war with the muggle world for space and control of the planet. This dark Lord would be different than any that came before as unlike Voldemort this person would have the backing of a country and more legitimacy. 

I know what your thinking, earlier I argued that the wizarding world is getting more progressive now I'm say there is going to be a war with them. The difference is I didn't say which ministry was going to war. It is clear that there are a great many. There is the British one in the main books then there is an American ministry, who is to say there is not a great many ministries just like in the muggle world, all with different ideas and ideals of how the world should work just like in this world. But it just takes one of them to be corrupted by a dark wizard or by bad politics for a war to start. 

In closing I belive this is inevitable as the population grows and poor people are squeezed more and more, hiding will seem almost pointless, the liklihood goes up and up as population rises. We know there are many dark wizards who could easily use this tension to rise up and exercise power, the angrier the people are the easier it will be to turn the anger on to an ""other"" in this case muggles. But there will still be progressive wizards and a progressive ministry who will fight to save muggles but this will most likely, with the massive number of wizards, lead to the unveiling of the wizarding world. The outcome of the war in my mind is irrelevant, as soon as it starts the wizarding world is over and it is just the world with whole new challenges of co habition.

I belive the only thing that could stop this outcome are more magical wars, if the wizarding world can't come together and get along long enough for their numbers to grow they can't outnumber muggles. If the magical community doesn't progress as is expected and doesn't become more welcoming to non magical people like squibs and muggleborns and pushes them out of the magical world and into the muggle one then the overpopulation won't happen as quickly or at all.

3- The engagement between Bellatrix and Rodolphus, and then Narcissa and Lucius. Did they try to find someone for Andromeda before she left? For Sirius and Regulus?

harrypotter,"Hot off the latest Xmas rewatch, I've been on a Potter bender.

One thing that stood out to me in this rewatch was Harry's emotional evolution and how expertly it's handled. I particularly love Harry's choices in Prisoner of Azkaban. See, a complaint about Harry Potter is that if he would just tell the adults AKA Dumbledore what's going on, a lot of problems would be solved. However, Book 3 really presents a plausible reason for Harry to not be able to share what he knows with Dumbledore, as Sirius is at first a personal vendetta Harry feels some shame for, and later as a fugitive, Harry can't fully expose Sirius.

Then, by the time Harry realizes he really just needs to tell Dumbledore what's up, the headmaster becomes a fugitive. Then, he dies.

So this question of ""Just tell the adults what you know"" becomes complicated very very quickly.

Now let's consider why Harry is the ""Boy who lived"". As he says, even up until Order of the Phoenix, his phenomenal 3/3 record against Voldemort is due to luck, help and unknown factors. He of all people, worthy because of confronting fear and danger courageously, nevertheless admits that his success is not in any way a product of his own skill or power.

Harry lived because of Lily's old magic spell. That was broken by Voldemort's deep spell. Azkaban, the only book where Harry did not confront Voldemort, features a telling prophecy, and the events surrounding Pettigrew. I suspect there is a link between the prophecy and the intention of Voldemort. In the magical world, powerful wizards shape events which become spells. These are mirrored by prophecies which become more true as the spells grow in power. Understand?

In the book ""Johnathan Strange and Mr. Norrell"" there are two gentlemen of England, who many years after the disappearance of magic, are somehow able to do it again. In the end, a strange and seemingly minor encounter with a malicious fey folk becomes a massive set of spells that changes England. It turns out this seemingly random, malicious fey might have been connected to the great master of English magic since Merlin, the Raven King. The random events circumscribing the lives of Johnathan Strange and Mr. Norrell turn out to be products of a weird and wonderfully planned spell by the Raven King to trick and defeat this powerful and evil fairy. The fairy is totally tricked, almost up to the level in which Eru Iluvatar tricks and defeats Sauron by using the curse of his own magic to - through Gollum by way of the kindness of Frodo - curse the Ring to meet its own demise.

I am completely certain, through Deathly Hallows, that Dumbledore used the Deathly Hallows - a very vague, mysterious, and tangentially but mysteriously powerful magic - to complete a spell he had been casting for many years. Harry Potter was merely a lucky ingredient of the spell to defeat Voldemort. Yes, Voldemort was defeated because of a masterful, god-tier advanced spell of Dumbledore in which Harry was a mere ingredient.

Thus, in this interpretation of advanced magic where manipulating people and events and incorporating varieties of magic produces strong and unimpeachable results, Slytherin House was made part of Hogwarts.

We easily forget the emblem of Ravenclaw isn't - lol - a raven. It's an Eagle. This is an imperial emblem. The lion is regal. The badger is defiant. The snake is something else.

Hogwarts is not merely a school. It is a spell cast upon English magic. It is as profound as the spell of the Raven King. It affects all English magic, and resonates through the wider world due to England's connection to old magic.

It's not that Slytherin is tolerated. Slytherin is part of the spell. The Basilisk was the spell's concession to Salazar. Yes, of course Slytherin is evil. But Hogwarts is a spell meant to drive a line between the muggle and magical worlds. To protect BOTH of them, and allow wizards to deal with the arcane and dangerous elements of the magical universe (goblins, beasts, elves, etc.)

Thus we must not think of Slytherin as evil. Instead. We must become part of the spell, the legacy of Merlin. We must be grateful that magic and muggle are regulated and put in order, for the benefit of both.

The topic of what muggles might do to the magical world is fascinating. It invokes the concept of ""before"" old magic. Of a magic that muggles can invoke, the grand and greater spells. Magic can't make food or gold. The mundane and profane can. Science is like a sweeping uber-magic. It's universal common sense. Plato's forms, shared by all to no one's benefit unless they are universally obeyed. Where the wizard can refuse to obey, the muggle must. But, the muggle, in obeying, might gain a greater power.

In other words, don't be so hard on Slytherin. Hogwarts is a wizard's spell and a grand one.",Is Slytherin Evil? Why Does It Exist. A Hot Merlin Take to Justify It All.,1673237597

I have never been a fan of David Yates. He ruined OotP for me by cutting out a lot of the scenes that really showcased Harry's growth as a character. I've always thought that the odd-numbered installments in HP (with the exception of Deathly Hallows) were more about character development and how everything was affecting him, while the even-numbered installments were more story-driven. Yet Yates cut most of those scenes out, and pulled a lot of punches (i.e. muting Harry's scream when Sirius falls through the veil and not having him lash out at Dumbledore the way he did in the book). And where the hell was the scene where it was revealed that Umbridge (who was nowhere near as sadistic as she was in the book) ordered the dementor attack on Harry? The only thing I was impressed by was his adapting the longest book in the series into the shortest film, but I think they could have made an alternate cut of the film with some of the scenes that were left on the cutting room floor being added and some of the existing scenes being cut which would be roughly the same length.

He got better with the subsequent films (possibly due to Steve Kloves returning as screenwriter) but they still weren't as good IMO as the first four films. I know that politics play a significant part in the story, but the tone of Yates's later films is a little too political IMO. Combining the politics with the way in which most of the characters are dressed in the later films hardly makes it seem like a fantasy film about wizards at all.

I don't agree with the stuff that JKR has said in recent years, but I think she's a good writer, and I think Steve Kloves is a good screenwriter. But David Yates is not a good director for the Wizarding World franchise because he doesn't know which scenes are essential to the story and which ones can be cut or re-worked. Also, Yates went from directing low-budget, made-for-TV movies to one of the largest franchises of all time without any stepping stones in between. Chris Columbus had ""Home Alone"", Alfonso had ""A Little Princess"", Mike Newell had ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" as well as an extensive resume dating back to the 1960s (I don't think his ""Bollywood"" direction style would have worked for most of the films but it worked for GoF), and Yates? The previous film he directed before OotP was ""The Girl in the Cafe"", and all of his films were either TV movies or shorts. Outside of the UK he was practically unknown. So he was an odd choice of director IMO.

I still think they have a shot at steering the FB franchise in the right direction but they need to get the right person for the job.","What if the reason why the FB series failed isn't because of JKR and the writers, but because of David Yates?",1673215994

harrypotter,"I decided to read through the HP books for the first time in many years, taking notes about various things as I did so to keep track of everything.

One of those things is the locations of various places within Hogwarts and, more specifically to this post, the entrance to the Gryffindor common room. I'd gotten the majority of the way through the first book believing that the entrance to the Gryffindor Tower was through a hole behind the portrait of the Fat Lady at the end of a corridor on the second floor.

My reason for thinking it's on the second floor is from a few pieces of evidence:

* When Percy first leads them to the common room from the Sorting Ceremony's feast, they climb multiple staircases - that puts it on a floor higher than floor 1 (i.e. at least floor 2).
* When going back to the common room after defeating the troll in the girls' toilet (which I believe is on the ground floor), Ron and Harry don't talk until they've climbed two floors up. Then a brief conversation is described and they reach the common room. From this quote, it's possible for the entrance to be more than two floors up, but I think it's implied to be on the second floor, and it's definitely not lower than the second floor.
* When going to the trophy room to duel Malfoy, they went up a staircase to the third floor. Now, even if there were more than just this one staircase (which isn't implied), this means that it's definitely below floor 3.

If it's at least as high as the second floor and lower than the third floor, it must be on the second floor - there's no other option.

Nothing contradicted this throughout the book, so I held fast to my belief. Until they sneak out at night to the forbidden third-floor corridor to stop ""Snape"" from stealing the Philosopher's stone. In this instance, they go up two sets of stairs - the first of which Mrs Norris is skulking at the top of and they climb around her, the second of which, which is mentioned as ""the staircase up to the third floor"", Peeves is floating halfway up.

I was a bit confused by the contradiction to what I thought was the truth, so I googled for the location of the Gryffindor common room. Imagine my surprise when all the sites say it's on the seventh floor! 

I looked at what the source for that is, and the wiki says ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game)."" Are the video games really the accepted source of canon over the books? Or is this backed up elsewhere in later books?

I'm going to note down the contradiction I found as a potential plot hole or potential for a strange Hogwarts layout (e.g. the first corridor led to a balcony halfway up the second floor and the second corridor led the rest of the way up to the third floor) and keep making notes as I read to try and figure it out. But the thing with the seventh floor is just crazy imo, since there are at least two quotes showing them going upwards from the common room to the third floor.

Jk Rowling should of written a book showing the life of Draco and his mother, by how their relationship and the lestrange family seem I’d think that Narcissus marriage to Lucius was arranged and abusive and that part of Dracos horrible attitude came from his home life and how his father was horrible to him and his mother. 
Rowling should of written a book showing a pov of Dracos home life and maybe even including how his mother and father met. Rowling then should of showed different areas of Draco’s life leading up to half blood Prince which then goes into Dracos battle with wanting to be good but being in a situation where he’s forced to be bad.

A book like this could of been really interesting and given Dracos character the depth it really needed.
However all in all I hate Dracos ending anyway I think a much better ending would be if at the end of half blood Prince he chose not to kill Dumbledoor by his own choice not Snape stopping him and then joined the order leading him to help out in deathly hallows and maybe once again in his own book showing the effects of him being a Slytherin who turned good!",Jk Rowling should of made a separate Draco Malfoy book showing his pov.,1673215274

&gt; He turned: there was Lucius Malfoy sitting in the darkest corner, ragged and still bearing the marks of the punishment he had received after the boy's last escape. One of his eyes remained closed and puffy. ""My Lord...please...my son...""

&gt;""If your son is dead, Lucius, it is not my fault. He did not come and join me, ***like the rest of the Slytherins***. Perhaps he has decided to befriend Harry Potter?""

harrypotter,"... and boy did it raise a lot of questions. However, I'll just post 2 here:

1] Do wizards have no due process at all? Percival Graves just gets to make an instant, one-man decision on the death penalty, and everyone is down with it? Like, it must happen a lot since a) the American ministry has its own built-in execution chamber, and b) everyone - including Tina's coworkers - is just cool with putting her down immediately. 

Moreover, do these people not consider themselves Americans *even slightly?* They're surrounded by normal humans whose entire country is built around a notion of established and inalienable human rights. But their little sect has no rights at all? They're SO removed from muggles that their system is tantamount to a rule-by-fiat dictatorship?

2] Why haven't wizards taken over the world? In the books, magic seemed, if not quite trivial, then at least relatively on-par with the power of one-man technology. This is to say that a single wizard couldn't utter a few words and set off the equivalent of a nuclear bomb. Even when Voldemort and Co. blew up a bridge, that appeared to be a) an extremely impressive feat, and b) a group effort by the Death Eaters.

In Magical Beasts, not only are single wizards essentially wordlessly shattering buildings, but it's pretty clear that average American Aurors are just amble to effortlessly reassemble said destruction in seconds. 

Moreover, we know from the books that even a lot of wizards who AREN'T Death Eaters consider themselves to be superior to the rest of humanity. So you have this subset of elitist super-beings, many of whom think they've transcended humanity, and... Grindlewald and Voldemort are just wildly ""out there"" in aiming for some form of world conquest/subjugation? Wha??",Saw Fantastic Beasts for the first time last night...,1673198915

harrypotter,"Hottake: The way most people understand the house system is wrong. The way most people seem to think it works is like star signs, where you get a full batch of personality traits that you need to adhere to, most of them being subject to fairly substantial change in a normal human ages 11 to 17. 
 Due to this, a lot of people decry the house system as impractical, and bad, something that I am inclined to agree with 
HOWEVER, I don’t think that this is how it was intended, at least not by the founders of Hogwarts. 
 In the legend of the Secret Chamber, McGonnagal tells us about the founding of Hogwarts. She says that the founders couldn’t agree on which students to teach, so they all taught their own houses. Slytherin wanted to teach purebloods, so to get into Slytherin you needed to be a pureblood. To get into Ravenclaw you needed to hold knowledge as the highest virtue, to get into Gryffindor you needed to be exceptionally brave, and Hufflepuff took the rest. 
 This interpretation is way more practical from the viewpoint of the founders, as it solves their original problem.
The different personality traits that are assigned to the houses, I think are prejudices that evolved later: Samrt people are awkward eggheads, Brave people reckless jocks, etc. Being a stereotype for your house was never an intended requirement to get in. 
 Now I realise, that the legend is the only confirmation we have of this interpretation, but I at least think that this is the version that makes the most sense.","The house system has been completely misunderstood, and retconned!",1673188675

My original thought was that George betted against Hermione, whereas Fred against Ron. In the books it is clear that George can be seen as somewhat more of the empathic brother, I feel like he might as well have more faith in Ron then Fred would have, who was rumored to end up with Hermione before the original ending of the series.

If you'd like to participate, please comment your wizarding world information (house, wand, and patronus), as well as any other information you'd like to (but you dont have to) include, like your gender identity, Myers-Briggs type, where you're from (state or country), etc.

For example, here's mine:
- House: Ravenclaw
- Wand: Hawthorn, Phoenix Feather, 11 3/4 inches, unyielding
- Patronus: Siberian Cat
- Gender Identity: Female
- Myers-Briggs Type: ISFJ
- Where I'm From: Wisconsin, USA

The only thing I ask is that you only comment your official wizarding world results, not which house/wand/patronus you'd like to have. And please don't comment your results if you knowingly answered dishonestly to get the result you wanted, just because I want to keep the data as accurate as possible.

I'll need quite a few people to comment in order to get a large enough sample size, so even if you dont want to participate, if you could at least upvote this thread so more people will see it, I'd appreciate it.

harrypotter,"Specifically, about the prophecy. I would've written about it in my previous thread about it (see here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/sxz2pn/in\_harry\_potter\_do\_the\_prophecies\_all\_come\_true/](https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/sxz2pn/in_harry_potter_do_the_prophecies_all_come_true/)) but it was locked, so I'm making a new one. 

The prophecy was to be fulfilled, of that I'm almost certain for two reasons: 

1) Dumbledore lied to him about the fact that he must die in order to destroy the last horcrux inside of him, something it was certainly needed to fulfill the prophecy. Dumbledore in ""Half-Blood prince"" tries to convince Harry of the importance of acting of his own free will, but this must be surely because, being a very smart man, he knew Harry would've acted against it at the last moment, and reassuring him he must choose himself ensures him the prophecy, not the headmaster, will correct Harry's path. Don't forget that Dumbledore's plan was for Harry to fight Voldemort AFTER destroying all the horcruxes, while we all know the snake was still alive at the time. 

2) For me, at the last duel of Harry v Voldemort, the clue that the prophecy was in action was the fact the Elder Wand belonged to Harry. In the hands of Voldemort, it wouldn't have worked. Especially because Harry didn't intend to kill Voldemort. Instead, the Avada Kedavra made by Voldemort rebounded, but it all acted automatically, after the prophecy set things in motion. Chance wasn't there at that duel.

He fought Dumbledore and judging from the film, Dumbledore didn’t have problems facing someone holding the wand.  Dumbledore fought Voldemort using the wand at the ministry and impression’s are, what the difference with a wand that everyone’s using?

harrypotter,"Growing up, I loved the Harry Potter series. I credit the series getting me interested in reading and the fantasy genre in general. It also inspired the loner child I was to make friends because I envied the friendship that the main characters had. 

As an adult I still loved the series in the same way that I love How the Grinch Stole Christmas - fondly with warm memories of bonding with friends and siblings over it and occasional rereads and rewatches. 

However now, post all the drama with Rowling, it’s just lost its place entirely in my life. I’ve not reread or rewatched any of the books or movies in years and any time I think of it or come across the series, I just feel deep disappointment. Today I attempted to engage by venturing into this sub after being away for a long time and I have finally conceded that it’s over for me.

harrypotter,"Obviously Snape would no sooner tell Harry hints to help him to his face, than award Gryffindor 10 points for a job well done in class, but considering he and Dumbledore were in on the ""protect Harry at all costs"" plot, you'd think one of them would step up to the job. As for Dumbledore, this is even dumber. Yeah, I know there's a magical contract (and it makes NO sense how a magical object that's meant to choose 17+ year olds for a inter-school contest would create a magical contract that's above Dumbledore's magical powers to destroy/change it), but the contract never stopped Harry from cheating, or anyone else from cheating, at that. And obviously, playing fair in a competition that's reward is fame and 1000 galleons to the winner, is nothing compared to the grand plan of stopping the greatest Dark Wizard who seeks to put the world under his foot.

So why, may I ask, did Dumbledore not take every measure necessary to ensure Harry's safety. The kid could've died several times over (he almost got slammed by a Horntail's tail in the movie and got slashed in the arm in the books). If I was Dumbledore, I'd be taking no risks and be secretly giving him info from the sidelines. Heck, I'd even manipulate the competition while it unfolds to ensure his safety (come on, he's the greatest Wizard to live, there's no way that he'd be unable to hoodwink some Ministry officials and a bunch of teenagers to help Harry cheat). As for Snape, you'd think he'd convey some handy tips to someone else who'd convey it then, to Harry. He's been anonymously watching Harry from the sidelines and it's stupid how he'd be willing to take such a gamble on Lily's sake on something so dangerous. Crazy how a Death Eater who wanted Harry dead ended up ensuring Harry's safety in the tournament more than people who had to keep him alive to destroy the Dark Lord.",Why didn't Dumbledore and Snape help Harry cheat,1673062975

harrypotter,"The series ends with the words “All was well”. But how can it be that all was well if nothing essentially changed after the defeat of Voldemort? 

The wizarding world is extremely racist towards every other sentient magical race (goblins, elves, merpeople, centaurs, giants, etc). Such a world allowed the Ministry of Magic to be formed, which constantly abuses its power and benefits from said racism (mainly via goblins and elves), while preventing all other races from using wands and thus maintaining their hegemony. It is out of that system that somebody like Voldemort rose to power and if you think about it nothing essentially changed after he was defeated. There were no systemic changes in their world that could prevent something like that happening again. And Voldemort really isn’t that much worse from the majority of other wizards, he is just more extreme and his racism extends to muggles and muggle-borns as well. 

After Rowling introduced elements to the world such as slavery or the goblin rebellions (in which the goblins had a violent uprising protesting against their mistreatment by wizards), defeating Voldemort simply isn’t a satisfying enough ending. 

Yet, none of the characters seem to care that the world is so broken. You would expect Harry to be a bit more empathetic considering he grew up in the muggle world and should thus not be desensitized but shocked at the inequality of this new world, yet he doesn’t care at all. When he finds out that Slughorn has been testing poisons on house elves his first thought it how annoyed Hermione would be. And the entire resolution to the slavery plot line is that elves enjoy being slaves. What the hell?

Rowling seems to think that just because Harry and Hermione now work for the ministry that everything is fine, when that would be impossible because the same broken systems still exist.",Why doesn’t a single character in the books care that the wizarding world is so broken and racist?,1673059585

I am currently reading her version of Prisoner of Azkaban (which is so far, the most gripping fanfic I have ever read) and it got me thinking: what if there was an entry for each book in the series featuring a different character? I thought it might be fun to outline some of my ideas and which story elements could be included in each book. Enjoy!

Book 1: 
Ron Weasley and the Black Knight
-the troll attack
-the Mirror of Erised
-sneaking off to Hagrid’s and Norbert
-the third floor corridor

-her heavy crush on Harry Potter
-encounters Moaning Myrtle
-the Chamber of Secrets

Book 3:
Hermione Granger and the Time Turner
This one has already been done justice, albeit with the title, “Hermione Granger and the Prisoner of Azkaban” thanks to SaraSmile416. Her primary storyline goes into great detail on the time turner and the emotional stress it puts on Hermione as she tries to keep everything in order, as well as the toll it takes on her friendships with Harry and Ron, Ginny, and a few others (I won’t spoil too much). Seriously, read it if you like the concept!

Book 4:
Fred and George Weasley and the Faux Galleons (Idk about that title, help me!)
-Ludo Bagman storyline
-Quidditch World Cup and the death eater attack
-attempt on the Goblet of Fire
-experimenting with their joke toys and candies
-starting their Wizard Wheezes business
-witnessing/betting on the tournament
-obtaining the galleons from Harry

Book 5:
Luna Lovegood and the Veil of Mysteries
-meeting Harry Potter
-friendship with Ginny and Neville
-being an outsider in the Ravenclaw house
-the Quibbler
-joining Dumbledore’s Army
-producing a patronus
-thestrals
-adventures in the department of mysteries

Book 6:
Draco Malfoy and the Vanishing Cabinet
-father going to prison
-his task given by Voldemort
-exploring his relationship with Narcissa
-petrifying Harry on the Hogwarts Express
-attempts on Dumbledore’s life (such the necklace and the wine bottle)
-sneaking into Slughorns party
-relationship with Snape
-inner turmoil with realizing he is not the person he thought he was
-Sectumsempra curse
-Mending the cabinet

Book 7:
Neville Longbottom and the Sword of Gryffindor
-Bill and Fleur’s wedding
-going to Hogwarts under Snape as headmaster
-dealing with the Carrows
-growing as a leader and person
-friendships with Ginny and Luna
-bringing Dumbledore’s Army back
-alliance with Aberforth Dumbledore
-Luna being taken by Death eaters
-the battle of Hogwarts
-pulling the sword out of the hat

Harry’s first prediction is that he will have a risk of getting burnt, the first task involved dragons. Ron’s prediction was that he would lose something most cherished, the second task ended up, having Ron kidnapped as as Harry’s most prized possession by the influence of mercury, Mercury = merpeople. The third prediction involved Harry getting betrayed by someone he thought as a friend,this could represent two things, Viktor Krum’s betrayal in the maze, or more importantly, Mad Eye Moody’s “betrayal” in disguise by Barty Crouch Junior. Harry thought of Moody as a mentor and helper by the end. The final prediction before they continued their homework, Harry says that he will come out worse in a fight at the end.

Since I started working on it, whenever I think of Rose Weasley's character I can't imagine her being white, I don't know why, maybe because of the actress chosen in the play. So my mind totally gave birth on its own to a headcanon with Rose Granger-Weasley being adopted by Ron and Hermione, while Hugo is their biological son. And so, as a result, I imagined her inner conflict with her mother, her having to be perfect all the time because she has an inferiority complex and doesn't want to disappoint her parents' expectations, the various problems she might get into by being the only one really ""different"" in a family of redheaded white people. I don't know, now I can't get out of it. When I was drafting the outline of the story all this was not contemplated, but now every time I come back to it it seems impossible not to write it that way.

But take an all-wizard family like the Weasleys.  If any of the underage kids living in The Burrow were to do magic, it would have to be assumed that the adults were the ones doing it.

What about reactive armour with layers which would be destroyed by the unforgivables and other major spells while protecting the wearer ? Having a large amount of shrunken Shields that would be automatically unshrunken and fixed on your hand when one is destroyed ? Bludgers who are enchanted to aim incoming spells ?

Fred and George have demonstrated that enchanted clothes can be usefull for minor spells. And they only use a simple Protego enchantment, nothing more powerfull.

Hermione ran forward and pulled the hat onto her head.  She heard a tickly little voice musing aloud.

""A lot of native intelligence here, very clever and keen.  Ravenclaw might suit you well...""

Hermione wondered if the hat could hear her worrying about her future prospects.

""Yes, of course.  We're both in here for the moment.  You know, keenness doesn't really cover it.  You might be better placed in Slytherin.  You're more ambitious than most and they could use...""

For her part, Professor McGonagall thought the Longbottom matriarch had odd ideas about how to raise a child but, having no children of her own, couldn't be entirely certain.  She lowered the hat onto Neville's head, and it dropped right down over his eyes.

""Ho, Longbottom!  It's been a while since I last spoke to a member of your family.  Keeping well, are they?""

*Um,* Neville began.

""Never mind, boy, just breaking the ice.  Oh, dear.""  The hat paused and Neville felt the strangest sensation that there was a mind inside his head, a mind besides his own, actually looking around.  ""Oh, dear.  You poor kid.  Oh, wait...""

If asked in the moment, Neville would have described it as feeling as if some mental boxes had been shifted aside.

""You'd make a good Hufflepuff, you know.  Professor Sprout and you will get along swimmingly.""

*But my gran says Huffs are a bunch of duffers and it's probably the best i can do.*

""Your gran doesn't have the insight on you that I do,"" grumbled the hat quietly, as a few cerebral closets were opened and gently sorted.  ""Oh.  Oh!""

*What?*

""GRYFFINDOR!""

*What?  Are you sure?*

""Never been surer, kid.  Off you go, GRYFFINDOR!""

""Malfoy, Draco.""

The hat came down over Malfoy's sneer as he waited for it to confidently tell him and the rest of the school what he knew was coming, but the voice inside his head surprised him.

""Hufflepuff.""

*What?!  NO!  My father will...I'm supposed to be a Slytherin, like my father!  You don't know what it's like...*

""No, lad, YOU don't know what it's like.  Huff House is full of good people from all walks of life, far more socially conscious than you are, I daresay, and you would benefit from meeting and getting to know them.  Open your eyes a little.""

Hi, I was recently playing on Potterworld (Java edition) and was intrigued by the way casting spells there works. Basically, you right click your wand and the spells appear on your hotbar. If you press Q it changes hotbar. Then, if you select the spell with a number or right click it from the inventory, the spell is selected and left clicking with the wand will cast it. 

So, I wonder if something like that is doable in MCBE world. 

I'm fully aware that some things are not doable in BE and using only commands, so I'll change something. 

First, hotbars. In BE you can use the /replaceitem just fine to make the player have a certain hotbar, so I'd use that or /give to give the player the items. However, unlike on Java, you can't save hotbars, so there's no way to know the hotbar that the player had BEFORE having the spells one selected to restore it. A solution to this might be simply having the world only for that purpose and nothing else, so the player wouldn't even have other stuff in the hotbar. 

To activate spells, I'd drop items. The dropped item would cause the spell to happen, but here's a problem:

The chamber of secrets can only be accessed by a parseltongue, which is a protection placed on it by slytherin himself so only his heir can be granted access. To think it could be fooled by a non parseltongue making hissing noises at it is pretty ludicrous.

Also, with the diadem, the fiend fire is set in the room of requirement and of all the attacks that could of been possibly used by crabbe(?) in that situation, he just so happened to chose the one very specific spell that can destroy horcruxes.

harrypotter,"As I’ve been recently replaying the Persona game series, I was thinking how much I’d love to play a character in a Hogwarts setting in that style.


For those unaware of the game mechanics, the player has a finite amount of time in the game where you play out almost every day in a calendar year. The main part of this is going to school, meeting up with your friends for various story beats, and actually doing the classes themselves. This involves certain days where the player is quizzed by the teacher or taking final exams. The character has to balance school, personal development and relationships on top of investigating murders, for example. There’s also part-time jobs to earn money outside of the “dungeon crawler” part of the game which is turn-based.


I think this desire is based on my love for Harry’s everyday school life in a magical school outside of the “saving the world” plot lines. 


I know we had some of this in the OG Harry Potter video games but it feels different when you know what quest triggers then next story progression so you know to delay it, versus active time management.","Looking forward to Legacy, however, the perfect Hogwarts game for me would be a Persona style game",1672997979

&gt; “You disgust me,” said Dumbledore, and Harry had never heard so much contempt in his voice. Snape seemed to shrink a little, “You do not care, then, about the deaths of her husband and child? They can die, as long as you have what you want?” 

Although one of my favorite characteristics of Dumbledore is his near unbreachable sense of calm, and how he keeps a level head in dire times, when others are susceptible to emotions and rash judgement. But the times where he shows hints of impatience and even anger to things he sees as injustice really bring out the human in him. I'm disappointed these parts were often cut out in movies and replaced with things like ""HARRY DID YOU PUT YOUR NAME IN THE GOBLET OF FIRE??!!!"" because those outburst don't convey the power and the same type of feel that these lines brought, just that the screenwriters know nothing about Dumbledore.

harrypotter,"1.
I thought of a story where they are all alive and hermione is actually Sirius’ biological daughter. Although i loves this character madly, he actually acts like an overgrown child and therefore plays his role as Harry’s godfather but doesn’t want to become a father. Hermione’s mother leaves her in front of Sirius’s house and he, against the will of the other marauders who were also willing to adopt her personally and raise her as their own daughter, decides to give her up for adoption because he doesn’t want to be her father and he didn’t want responsibility. He wanted to enjoy life as a man without problems and when he takes her in his arms for the first time at the request of the marauders he doesn’t feel that feeling that every father should feel, which James felt with Harry, but just feels an enormous weight on his shoulders but, he calls her Hermione before leaving her at the muggle orphanage because he knew a muggle name would make his mother turn in her grave and that’s why she calls herself by a short name because she didn’t want anything from the man who had left her without caring. They meets years later at the station when everyone is accompanying Harry for his first year and again when Harry invites her over to his house for the holidays having become great friends with the brilliant but silent little girl who has a morbid obsession with playing by the rules. They slowly learns more about her life and that to adopt Hermione was a horrible family that mistreats her, especially her adoptive father who punishes her whenever she doesn’t follow the rules, and then Sirius repents and tries to bond with his daughter and raise her and things like that. Obviously it will be a difficult path and Sirius will have to live with remorse but as soon as he sees her exactly as he was at her age, alone and with few friends he can really call his family, unwanted without knowing why by both of her biological parents and hated by the foster ones, he feels that feeling he hadn’t felt many years ago when he first picked her up. Hermione had his eyes, his hair, his instilled spirit rebellious and loyal to the point of error and that girl, little but strong as a lion, was his responsibility, she was a child, his child, and he had disappointed her already too much. If I weren’t so bad at writing I would do it but I leave the idea here in case someone wants to use it tell me because I would really be happy to read this fanfic.  

2. 
Hermione is the daughter of Sirius and after the end of the war and discovering the truth about her father she goes back to the past to change the future, to save lives, families. She becomes friends with the Marauders, initially suspicious, even if Sirius immediately feels a strange sensation towards her, as if his world suddenly depends on the smile of a little girl who he knows very well he doesn’t love, not the way adults love themselves but the way he saw James’ parents love him, until they see Hermione’s scar. She meets her father, who died before knowing that she was his daughter, and eventually Sirius discovers that Hermione is his biological daughter from the future and for the first time in his life, this life, he had a family that was his own.","Harry Potter FanFiction idea, again, because no one thinks of me so please,pleaseeeeeeees, If anyone wants to write it, let me know.",1672964273

Instead, he takes the full blame which would have had him sent to Azkaban if he had chosen to Surender to the Minister. And the ministry uses this to undermine him. 

I guess my question is could Dumbledore have known as early as OoTP that he would be dead before Voldemort was defeated and that Harry would need the support of the wizarding world to win, and therefore take the blame to keep Harry's 'reputation' from being besmirched? or was he just shielding Harry from whatever punishment the ministry might have for him?",Did Dumbledore know he would not see the end of Voldemort,1672958491

harrypotter,"While obviously I think her end goal of giving house elves fair working conditions was the right one. She was too self righteous to actually listen to what the elves themselves wanted.

And she's probably right when she says that the elves think that way because they've been conditioned to, but that doesn't change the fact that it's counter intuitive to want to force them to be free. I think that's the point Hagrid and Ron and everyone else is trying to make when they try to talk her out of it. We see that ultimately none of them agree with house elves being mistreated and enslaved, they just don't think Hermione will be able to set them free if they don't want to be free.

She got too greedy with her short and long term goals. Instead of getting them wages her short term goal probably should've been to pass legislation to ensure they're not mistreated, then hopefully elves would start realizing their value and want and seek freedom for themselves, just like it happened with Dobby. We see how fair treatment does so much to improve their lives with Dobby and Kreacher. Her long term goals should've been getting them fair wages, and it's a goal the elves themselves should help her with or want to help her with.

It's an interesting conundrum that shows that the right thing maybe obvious sometimes but that doesn't mean everyone will see that way, and that doesn't mean the solution is equally as obvious.

harrypotter,"It is well known that Snape is a master of deception, successfully deceiving Voldemort for years, if not decades. This is no small feat. Not to mention his master of Occulemncy.

harrypotter,"Can we stop with this question already?! I get so tired of seeing it. It is such a ridiculous question and I don't just mean because wizards basically shun anything that is a muggle-specific invention or because they would be able to cast enchantments to protect themselves, but because it takes away from what is supposed to be a magical world. I enjoy Harry Potter because it allows me to escape into another world. Is that world perfect? Of course not. Does it have parallels to the real world? Absolutely.  

But adding guns to that world doesn't add anything to the experience. If anything it takes away from it. The worst curses in the Wizarding Universe can't just be used at will. They require intent (""You have to mean it"") to be effective. So to kill someone, you have to *want* to kill them. To torture someone you have to *want* to cause pain. I think this distinction is important because it provides more insight into the motivations and qualities of the characters. 

Harry tries to torture Bellatrix but his curse isn't successful because he's not the type of person that would want to torture someone. This distinction is what makes the characters in Harry Potter so relatable. We have all had moments where we let ourselves be ruled by our emotions, but we don't act on the thoughts we might have because that's not who we truly are and reason takes over. Adding guns to the equation would eliminate the nuances of the story and make the characters and the world incredibly one dimensional.

This turned into much more than I originally intended. Thank you for attending my Ted Talk.","The ""Why don't wizards use guns"" Question",1673626191

It would maybe involve characters like Oliver wood or other quidditch players from the books. it would be canon using a real team like puddlemere united but it doesn't effect the main movies at all and would just be a fun spin-off and that gives more insight to quidditch and wizarding world sports culture.

Now that isnt enough, a year later, that damn Aunt literally gets blown up and drifts away in the sky.

harrypotter,"In the 21st century?

After what happened with the Second Wizarding war, perhaps its smart for it to become an option if the Auror chooses, to be trained in the art of firearm usage/safety.  I'm not talking about rifles or shotguns, but concealed handguns.  For the most part, the Auror still acts as an Auror usually does, and still uses magic/wand.

But knowing how to use a handgun efficiently and keeping it hidden from potential enemies, could be beneficial.  From what we know about Dark Wizards, they don't use muggle weapons.  If confronted by a dark wizard, a handgun could be a surprise towards the dark arts user.  Giving the good guys an edge.  Combing the art of wielding magic well with knowledge/wand and the advantages a handgun has.

harrypotter,"People are always on about how the films removed this and cut out that or whatever, and even me included too. I love the books and some scenes deserve to be set in the big screen, but what about things that were never in the books? And was only in the films. Just to clarify, when i mean additions, i don't mean changes. Like the film didn't add harry killing quirrel, they just changed it. And this isn't all of the things they actually added, just some of the worst i believe.

POA is widely considered like the best of the franchise, and i honestly could never see it. At best it's bad and at worst is terrible. But when thinking about it, there's one thing i usually used to overlook, and that is lupin. I never really considered about him that much, but recently i made a post about him, and it got me thinking. Why do they add him talking about lily so much? It makes no sense and it kinda feels like he had a thing for her or something, but why would he? He barely says a word about lily in the books? Comes completely out of nowhere. It's like it's a complete 180 of his character, he loves james simple as that, where was lily? Yeah, nowhere.

HBP is like the complete opposite of POA, everyone pretty much knows it sucks and yeah they're right. This film is complete doo doo. And this one has not just one bad addition but more, and one of them concerns the character of slughorn. And again, his relationship with lily. I don't know why people say they prefer his story about the fish in the film? I never really gelled with it and find it kinda dumb. Like in the books he tells about him what about happened that night his parents died, which is so much more impactful. We rarely get to even really see the truth about what happened his parents died, and in the next book we actually see it happened. And it's a shame, because it feels like it's left forgotten in the films.

But oh know HBP couldn't just help itself, and added an even dumber addition, the burning of the burrow. This one makes like absolutely no sense. Not only is not even canon, not only is it never brought up, not only does it take away one of the best highlights of the book with harry and scrimgeour in the burrow during this time in the book, we also get that stupid scene harry and ginny. It's so baffling and just completely useless. Like the next time we see the burrow, it's completely fine and is never brought up again. It's like you never fred or george be like ''ah man this shit reminds of the time the burrow burned down'' or something like that idk. And also not just that, it looks completely ugly af. The stupid ass shaky cam hurts my eyes so much and gives me chronic diarrhea.

And that brings me to another scene that also has some stupid shaky cam, and isn't in the books, that horrible chase scene in DH part 1. I honestly even forgot about this and wasn't even going to mention it, but that doesn't it mean it can get off scot free. This shit is just so like just dumb. THEY COULD EASILY JUST APPARATE AWAY! AND I CAN'T EVEN SEE WHAT'S GOING ON! AND HOW DO THE SNATCHERS EVEN FIND THEM!? WHAT! I'm sorry, i'm usually not like this when watching films, but this just is just so stupid and makes no sense at all.

And we're still on the same film, because guess what, it even get's worse. That stupid ass dance scene with harry and hermione. And before anyone says this is just some dumb shit between friends, even emma watson said in an interview, she saw this scene as like something that could happen between friends and like they both think they could be something more. And even the next scene hermione and harry look into their eyes lovingly, and even she also says ''what if we just grow old together''. And also the fact that they cut out this line, that pretty much ended the harry/hermione debate and if they would end up together:

*“After you left,” he said in a low voice, grateful for the fact that Ron’s face was hidden, “she cried for a week. Probably longer, only she didn’t want me to see. There were loads of nights when we never even spoke to each other. With you gone . . .” He could not finish; it was only now that Ron was here again that Harry fully realized how much his absence had cost them. “She’s like my sister,” he went on. “I love her like a sister and I reckon she feels the same way about me. It’s always been like that. I thought you knew.”*

I like the song they're dancing to at least, but other than that, that scene is just there to give harmione shippers some a wet dream or whatever. And it even stings ever harder because the scene before this, is quite possibly the worst scene in all of HP canon (not tcc), harry and ron's fight. This shit is so baffling and just downright idiotic. And especially the line, ''your parents are dead! YOU HAVE NO FAMILY!'' Like book ron would never outright or even come close to saying something like that, that shit is on another level of bad. It's just mind boggling the extent that these films would go to antagonize ron and demonize him, they spend all of their stupid ass camping scene montage or whatever, to facilitate that there might be something between harry and hermione and ooh ron's jealous or whatever. It's useless they're just building up for this stupid fight for half the movie and it's just a complete joke. It's like it's memed so much to the point where it really is a joke at this point.

harrypotter,"Upon a current reread of the series, I find similarities between Harry Potter and Hindu Mythology. At the same time, Rowling pulled elements from the Christian mythos for her books and some from other myths. Some parts of the series speak to me as an Indian reading the series. Let me start with the apparent similarities between the story elements of Harry Potter and famous Indian mythological stories. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Prophecy that Harry must kill Voldemort bares similarities to the story in the Bhagavatam of how an evil king named Kansa received a premonition that the eighth nephew of his would be his killer. While in Harry's case, it was the same except with Voldemort, and how did the two react? 

&amp;#x200B;

Kansa went on a murder spree, killing seven of his nephews before the eighth, a reincarnation of Lord Vishnu himself, and escaped his clutches in the form of Krishna, and Voldemort began targeting the Potters. While in Harry's case, something similar happens when he destroys Voldemort as a baby for the time being, losing his parents in the process. While this is one of the more apparent similarities I have noticed, the trope of a chosen hero or chosen one is quite common in stories.  

&amp;#x200B;

The second thing that struck me was the same scenario in the Mahabharat that led to the death of a famous warrior called Abimanyu was almost the same as the maze in the fourth book. The first is that Harry, like Abimanyu, had to cross a maze to reach the centre of it. In both cases, they found themselves fighting for their lives while no one else could see what was transpiring inside the maze. Finally, both cases ended with some form of tragic circumstances, with Harry's being that he saw Cedric Diggory get killed and Voldemorts return, and Abimanyu lost his life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, Dumbledore's character and Voldemorts resemble the characters of Shakuni and Lord Krishna from the Mahabharata. Especially both are the only ones that can counter the other schemes and plans. Eventually, leading to the death of the other; however, in Dumbledore's case, he dies trying to bring down Voldemort. At the same time, Dumbledore's death and the fall of Bhisma, the grandsire of the dynasty that is the centre of the Mahabharata, are almost the same.

&amp;#x200B;

 Given that many people stop to grieve the loss of both, at the same time, Dumbledore being unable to stop the rise of Voldemort for the second time is an uncanny similarity to how Bhisma was unable to stop the war that is the centrepiece of an Indian epic called the Mahabharata from happening.

&gt;As Dumbledore spoke, Harry heard a rustle behind him and rather‬ thought Kingsley whispered something. He could have sworn too that‬ he felt something brush against his side, a gentle something like a‬ draft or bird wings, but looking down he saw nothing there.‬
…
&gt;‪“Miss Edgecombe,” said Umbridge at once, “tell us how long these‬ ‪meetings have been going on, dear. You can simply nod or shake your‬ ‪head, I’m sure that won’t make the spots worse. Have they been happening regularly over the last six months?”‬ Harry felt a horrible plummeting in his stomach. This was it, they‬ ‪had hit a dead end of solid evidence that not even Dumbledore would be able to shift aside…‬
…
‪&gt;Everyone in the room was gazing at the top of Marietta’s face. Only‬ ‪her eyes were visible between the pulled up robes and her curly fringe.‬ ‪Perhaps it was a trick of the firelight, but her eyes looked oddly blank.‬
‪&gt;And then — to Harry’s utter amazement — Marietta shook her head.‬
‪&gt;Umbridge looked quickly at Fudge and then back at Marietta.‬ ‪“I don’t think you understood the question, did you, dear? I’m asking whether you’ve been going to these meetings for the past six‬ ‪months? You have, haven’t you?”‬
‪&gt;Again, Marietta shook her head.‬
‪“What do you mean by shaking your head, dear?” said Umbridge‬ ‪in a testy voice.‬
&gt;‪“I would have thought her meaning was quite clear,” said Professor‬ ‪McGonagall harshly. “There have been no secret meetings for the past‬ ‪six months. Is that correct, Miss Edgecombe?”‬
‪&gt;Marietta nodded.‬
&gt;‪“But there was a meeting tonight!” said Umbridge furiously.‬ ‪“There was a meeting, Miss Edgecombe, you told me about it, in the‬ ‪Room of Requirement! And Potter was the leader, was he not, Potter‬ ‪organized it, Potter — why are you shaking your head, girl?”‬
&gt;‪“Well, usually when a person shakes their head,” said McGonagall‬ ‪coldly, “they mean ‘no.’ So unless Miss Edgecombe is using a form of‬ ‪sign language as yet unknown to humans—”‬
‪&gt;Professor Umbridge seized Marietta, pulled her around to face her,‬ ‪and began shaking her very hard.‬
…
&gt; ‪Marietta was standing exactly where Umbridge had released her.‬ ‪She seemed neither perturbed by Umbridge’s sudden attack, nor relieved by her release. She was still clutching her robe up to her oddly‬ ‪blank eyes, staring straight ahead of her. A sudden suspicion connected to Kingsley’s whisper and the thing he had felt shoot past him‬ ‪sprang into Harry’s mind.‬

(this is copied and paraphrased a bit from ch27. i hope my mobile formatting is okay.)

now, i always assumed that he’d confunded her. perhaps even obliviated her. but on a recent reread, i realized that a confundus charm’s purpose is to *confuse.* it does not make you do what the caster wants you to or believe what they want you to believe, unless they instruct you verbally perhaps (we never see this happen, but it’s implied by snape in PoA and DH when he uses the confundus as a reason to discredit people that you can use it to convince someone of incorrect information). so why is marietta shaking her head here, rather than agreeing with umbridge? why is she so blank and docile and nonreactive?

harry gets “a suspicion” as to what’s been cast, indicating he finds this behaviour familiar, recognizable. at this point, he has never seen anyone confunded. i checked with potter-search.com and at that point, the confundus has only been referenced: by snape in PoA, and by barty in GoF. the first time we see someone confunded on-page is mclaggen in HBP: he goes “lumbering off in the wrong direction” and is confused and stumbling about knocking into things for the rest of the day. he doesn’t lose awareness. nothing like marietta, who’s not confused at all. she’s calm and cooperative. harry saw plenty of that in “moody’s” defense class in GoF.

Harry potter has some of the best selling books of all time, something like that is hard to compare to, especially when there are hundreds and hundred of other books extremely well made that dont even come close, sure its harry potter and that but when you think of ""harry potter"" you think of Daniel Radcliffe, not harry potters kids, its just become so iconic and well chiseld into our brains a new franchise would be overlooked and wouldnt be able to compare.

My second reasoning is what story would there be to tell, she says its gonna be about the aftermath and people really want to see it but the story kinda ended at that moment, it would be hard to introduce a new villain as there are not really any others mentioned and it wouldnt be very creative, sure there are other worlds in the wizarding universe but why not just make a new story not a hp one.

My last reason is targeted audience, it would be very hard to do as older people or anyone above 10 really would find the original franchise to be to good and nostalgic to be surpassed and the newer generations with the world is advancing would be alot more put off because of jk being transphobic which caused massive backlash

harrypotter,"I don't have a bad opinion of Slytherin house. I can find the given value in every Hogwarts house. In Ravenclaw, for example, knowledge, the desire to know and the love of science. In Hufflepuff, honesty, integrity and honor. In Gryffindor, determination, courage, strength and loyalty. And in the Slytherin house, cunning, ingenuity, ambition, willingness to act and dedication.

I respect all houses equally, but I feel that for some reason the Slytherin house is considered by many people to be the worst and most evil house to belong to. After all, those malicious and evil people who basically do not even deserve the epithet ""human"" end up in this house. Perhaps they are not worthy of being placed in another Hogwarts house based on their own limitations, cowardice, weakness, stupidity and evil and malicious violent, psychopaths behavior. In this way, they spoil the Slytherin reputation and everyone identifies the Slytherin house with these people.

(I have often wondered why there isn't a fifth house, where the useless, incapable of living, or the evil and perverted good-for-nothings are assigned? The name of this house could be MOSGLAMACH. From Old Irish MOSACH; shaggy, rough, bristly bristly, grumpy, surly. And from SGLAMHACH - hungry dog or mastiff - and the animal of the house could be a mad dog with a foaming mouth.)

People with weak abilities, or possibly characterless and infinitely evil people (who are not suitable for any other Hogwarts house due to their inability to live and their inferior character) are just an afterthought.

Apart from them, the Slytherin house could be just as worthy of respect and honor as the other houses. Because not only vile and inferior people came from this house. E.g. Severus Snape - whom I don't think I need to introduce to anyone (I'd rather describe him as a misunderstood, tragic hero), Narcissa Malfoy, who didn't tell Voldemort that Harry Potter was alive, Regulus Black, who was the first to confront Voldemort by stealing his horcrux, or Horace Slughorn - one of my personal favorite characters - who was an extremely utilitarian and calculating man, yet still helped in the fight against Voldemort.

However, there is something about Slytherin house that I still can't wrap my head around to this day. That is, how could a supposedly ""wise wizard"" who is one of the founders of Hogwarts be able to leave a monster for posterity whose task is to destroy innocent children - just because they are ""mudbloods""? I've also read a theory that Salazar did this to protect wizards from traitors who might betray them to the ""muggle inquisitors"" and possibly tell them all the secrets of wizarding society. But I think it's extremely drastic and rude to unleash a Basilisk-level monster on ignorant and innocent children - who know nothing and want no harm. 

This act of Slytherin Salazar basically defined his personality, and it is why everyone considers the Slytherin house to be the most despised house - at least among those who do not belong to it. (E.g.: Everyone at Hogwarts was always cheering against for Slytherin - especially in the Quidditch matches and every Hogwarts houses hated the Slytherin house.) 

The problem is that there is no concrete explanation in the books as to why the founder of the Slytherin house was a potential child killer - which is almost the same level of evil as Voldemort.",What drove Slytherin Salazar to become a child killer and establish Slytherin's bad reputation for generations?,1673538328

It plays a huge part in Deathly Hallows, but I can't remember if this rule is exclusive to the Elder Wand. If it's a rule for all wands, then it'd be pure chaos. Witches and wizards would be constantly trying to regain the trust of their wand; disarming whoever disarmed them, in an endless cycle of revenge dueling.

For instance, did Snape ever regain ownership of his own wand from Hermione after what happened in the Shrieking Shack?

harrypotter,"My girlfriend and I are visiting New York City this weekend and she brought up the idea of seeing grabbing some cheaper last minute tickets to Cursed Child on Broadway. 

A couple years ago I listened to the audiobook of Cursed Child on a long lonely road trip and I honestly didn’t hate it! I didn’t think it was great and had some wtf moments, but as I was driving alone in the dark I was happy to be back in this world. My girlfriend hasn’t read the script or seen the play so everything will be fresh to her. I see it’s now a slimmed down 3 hour show so that has peaked my interest. While it’s hard to find anything positive about Cursed Child on the internet, every review I’ve seen of the stage show has said it’s fantastic, the visuals are stunning and well worth it.

Harry Potter has played a massive role in both our lives and our relationship. I have an extreme case of Dyslexia and the Harry Potter books are what got me to learn to read. As I grew older, Harry learning to cope with his alienation from his peers helped me to cope with the alienation I was feeling. The last couple of years have renewed my interest in the series, turning to the books for solace to help find comfort to confront the adult world. So yes, this series means a lot to me and if this is my one chance to see anything Harry Potter in person, I don’t think it’s something to pass up.

It will also be fitting because I remember I was sitting outside by myself in New York City when I was around 11 or 12 years old when I finished reading Deathly Hallows and was a defining moment of my life. That moment was the first time I really felt myself growing up.

It actually makes more sense for her to take the lead, since Harry's rather shy and unsure of himself, and Ginny has more confidence and experience with dating.

Proof from canon that Ron is a terrible friend.

1. Ron is rude. In Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, when Ron first meets Harry, he asks Harry if he really has the scar and stares at Harry's scar, making Harry uncomfortable.
2. Ron is insensitive. After the Levitation Charm lesson in Sorcerer's Stone, Ron talks mean about Hermione behind her back and makes her go cry in the bathroom. And, no, it wasn't something Ron said to Harry in private, Ron made his mean comments about Hermione in a crowded corridor.
3. Ron approves of murder. In Chamber of Secrets, while discussing why Riddle might have gotten an award for Special Services to the School, Ron says ""maybe he murdered Myrtle, that would have done everyone a favor. So Ron is actually Draco like.
4. Ron has misplaced priorities. In Prisoner of Azkaban, Ron commits the sin of caring more about a pet than a friend. The bottom line is that the falling out between Ron and Hermione in Prisoner of Azkaban is Ron's fault. The reason it is Ron's fault is because of how inappropriately he handled the initial disappearance of Scabbers. Ron was absolutely in the wrong to shake bedsheets in Hermione's face and yell at her in one of the most public settings of Hogwarts, the Gryffindor Common Room. Ron later meanly freezes Hermione out of the food party in the Gryffindor Common Room after their Quidditch win over Ravenclaw. When Harry tries to help Hermione, he yells again and makes poor Hermione run off crying. When confronted by Harry by this, Ron unfairly says ""If she just acted like she was sorry"" The problem with this is that Ron had no right to expect an apology from Hermione for anything unless and until he first apologized to her for shaking bedsheets in her face, yelling at her, and humiliating her in front of the whole common room. Personally, the ONLY way I will EVER apologize to anyone for anything is if the person who feels wronged by me informs me of how they feel they've been wronged by me in a 100% calm, 100% polite, 100% classy, 100% non yelling, and 100% non in your face manner. If someone yells at me, humiliates me, gets in my face, and shakes materials in my face, I will NEVER apologize to them for anything even if it is an indisputable truism that I owe them an apology unless and until they first apologize to me for the yelling, humiliation, in your faceness, etc. Bare in mind that being humiliated is a MUCH worse position to be in than the position Ron was in. Then, later on, Ron won't listen to Hagrid when Hagrid gives his correct perspective that Ron should value his friend more than rats. Remember: FRIENDS SHOULD ALWAYS BE VALUED ABOVE PETS! NO EXCEPTIONS!. Even minor level friendships such as Harry Potter and Katie Bell should always be valued above pets. Harry should care MUCH more about Katie than about Hedwig. Since Ron and Hermione are actually close friends, it's MUCH more true that Ron should care far more about Hermione than about Scabbers. The caveat is this: If Ron would have approached Hermione in a classy and polite manner and informed her of what he thought had happened and what his evidence was in a classy and polite manner, he would then have been justified in expecting an apology from Hermione. Here's what Ron should have done: He should have left the bedsheets in the dorm, calmly approached Hermione in the common room, and asked her for a word. He should then have asked her to follow him up to his dorm and talked to her in private. He then should have showed Hermione the bedsheets and cat hairs and explained that Scabbers was gone and that the evidence pointed to Crookshanks eating Scabbers without yelling. Had Ron handled the situation this way and Hermione still completely denied that the evidence pointed to Crookshanks eating Scabbers, Ron would have been MUCH more justified in becoming angry with Hermione after that. But, Ron needed to understand that no one is going to apologize for anything if you yell at them, humiliate them, or shake materials in their face. Acting like that is only going to rile people up and make people angry and defensive. Being yelled at will also freak most people out. While ""friends should always be valued above pets"" is a hill I will forever die on, I would have MUCH more respect for the opinion that Hermione should have apologized to Ron if Ron himself had handled himself in a classy manner like he should have.
5. Ron is untrusting. Ron falls out with Harry in Goblet of Fire because he doesn't doesn't trust Harry enough. After knowing him for three plus years, Ron should know Harry well enough both to know that he would never have put his own name in the Goblet of Fire knowing the extra attention that would bring as Harry hated fame and attention AND that Harry would NEVER go behind his back or exclude him. Ron knows Harry well enough that he should have trusted Harry and not been suspicious of him. If I were Harry Potter, I would never have forgiven Ron for this betrayal and would never have had anything to do with him ever again. After the 1st Task, Harry should have removed Ron from his life and fully embraced his friendship with Hermione, who proved through her loyalty and support after Harry's name came out of the Goblet of Fire that she and not Ron was Harry's true Bestie. If Harry needed more than one best friend he should have become closer with Neville, Ginny, or Luna. Always remember that it is an indisputable truism that Ron was 1000% unjustified in not supporting, not believing, and not trusting Harry here. Always remember that it is an indisputable truism that this falling out was 100% Ron's fault and 0% Harry's fault. Harry literally didn't do anything wrong and Ron had NO legitimate justification for not supporting, believing, and trusting Harry more here.
6. In Order of the Phoenix, Ron is rude to first years in his prefect duty and calls them midgets.
7. In Half Blood Prince, Ron rudely takes an armchair by fire from an innocent first year. (Hermione does the right thing and gives the armchair back to the first year.)
8. Ron is observed to be unkind by Luna. On page 310 of Half Blood Prince, Luna says that Ron is unkind and that she had noticed that last year. Consider the fact that lovely and awesome Luna feels no affection for Ron and thinks him unkind.
9. In Half Blood Prince, Ron is mean to his Quidditch teammates and makes Demzela cry.
10. The worst part of all: Ron is disloyal. Ron literally betrayed and abandoned both Harry and Hermione on the road in the middle of a WAR. When you betray and abandon your two best friends on the road in the middle of a WAR, then you are NOT loyal but are a fair weather friend. You can't blame the Horcrux because both Harry and Hermione were it is well and neither of them ever abandoned each other or the mission. You also can't blame hunger. Neither Harry nor Hermione had any more to eat than Ron did. You can't blame conditions either. Harry and Hermione didn't have any comfortable beds or anything any more than Ron did. Even in general, Harry and Hermione had better attitudes toward the Horcrux Hunt than Ron and both did far less worrying and whining than Ron did. Harry was right on the money when he said that Ron knew he signed up for. Ron knew that the Horcrux Hunt wasn't going to be flowers and chocolates. This was the moment that made Ron 1000% irredeemable and proved for good that Hermione and not Ron was Harry's true Bestie and truly loyal friend. Ron literally betrayed and abandoned both Harry and Hermione on the road in the middle of a WAR. When the going got tough, Ron got going and ditched his friends. That's a fair weather friend for you.

So you know how in the Prisoner of Azkaban movie (especially the first dementor scene on the train to Hogwarts) the screen effect symbolizing the dementor stealing the soul of a person? I am of the opinion that, compared to some of the amazing videography of POA, this was a really poor representation of the effect. 

On the other hand, Sirius laying by the lake at the end of the movie and the soul-mass(?) temporarily exiting/reentering his body was absolutely fantastic. I just really didn't care for the blurry screen effect; it just doesn't seem like the right way to animate it to me.  However, at the same time, I'm not the type of person to ordinarily complain without trying to come up with a better solution and honestly nothing immediately occurs to me as a better portrayal method.

harrypotter,"**...are there any that hit you harder when you watched the movies versus when you read the books?**

I know that book vs. movie discussion threads are extremely common, and one thing I have noticed is that a lot of people will also discuss how the changes that were made to the movies affected how they felt about a particular character's death as opposed to how they felt when they read the books.  Now, while many people have expressed that the movies lessened the impact of some characters' deaths for them, I am wondering if there are any instances where the movies might have heightened the impact of a character's death.

Personally, I noticed that Hedwig's death actually hit me harder when I watched *Deathly Hallows: Part 1* as opposed to when I read her death in the book.  There's just something about my favorite Snowy Owl's dying while actively trying to protect Harry (movie death) as opposed to dying while sitting in a cage (book death) that caused me to lose more tears while watching the movie versus while reading the book.

harrypotter,"During the scenes going back to the Triwizard Tournament, it cuts to the Ludo Bagman commentary that was happening in the background of Goblet of Fire. In that, we get this:

&gt;If you’re from Hogwarts. Give me a cheer.

&gt;*There’s a loud cheer*

&gt;If you’re from Durmstrang — give me a cheer

&gt;*There’s a loud cheer*

&gt;AND IF YOU’RE FROM BEAUXBATONS GIVE ME A CHEER

&gt;*There’s a slightly limp cheer*

I’m unsure whether it was just an abysmal attempt at humour in Fleur doing poorest in the tasks, or if the writers genuinely thought there were less people there from Beaxbatons. 

Just to give perspective, Beaxbatons is stated to have a far bigger castle than both Hogwarts and Durmstrang. While some of that might just be for show, you have to take into consideration that ,unlike Hogwarts, Beaxbaton’s general population isn’t only from one country as they house wizards from numerous Central European countries surrounding France. 

Granted, I imagine it’s similar with Durmstrang, but they certainly wouldn’t give off a “limp cheer”. This might seem like a small complaint compared to every other dumb thing in the play, but it’s just further proof that the two writers with power in the script didn’t have an inkling of interest in putting the effort in respecting the source material.",Reason #164 to hate the Cursed Child,1673478120

harrypotter,"A lot of people like to criticize Yates for his work but I personally thought he was one of the better directors for Potter. Im speaking about only his 4 Potter films as I think the FB films weren’t consistent or coherent enough as a story. 

When I look at Yates’s work, I think of camera moving and imagery storytelling. His films, outside of Alfonso Cuaron, felt the most cinematic and emotional of any in the series. In most of his films, he gets great performances from the actors and always has this gritty tone to the films that were needed for the back half of the series. His adaptations were decent but I attribute that to the lack of runtime in the film(s). Him and Steve Kloves had great chemistry together in my opinion. 

If David Yates was around given the option to direct Goblet of Fire, a far better narrative than Order of Phoenix imo, I’m sure we would’ve gotten a more darker and tonally consistent film that Newell’s Goblet of Fire. 

•The Death eater attack would’ve been a little longer. 

•The Dragon chase would be significantly toned down or removed 

•The 3rd task would’ve included more creatures and jump scares for the audience.

I see so many posts of people saying that they go back to the movies to feel good, to feel at home, to be comforted. I don't feel that way.

I need at least a year between two watches of the series.

Personally, I think Warner should do what they seem to be already testing with Hogwarts Legacy: use Hogwarts, but in a different context. If Hogwarts Legacy works, I can see them creating a TV series taking place in Hogwarts, possibly also taking place in a different time period. Maybe the first season could be during Hogwarts's foundation and start from there, with the founders, as the heads of their respective houses, helping Hogwarts studying deal with their struggles, while also dealing with their own struggles.

They could just call it ""Hogwarts"", or, if they want to make the fandom happier, maybe they could call it ""Hogwarts: A History"".

It was all because of his love for Lilly that set him in the path to goodness. Snape heard about what Voldemort planned and begged Dumbledore for help all because he didn't want Lilly to die. He didn't care about Harry or James. And what would've happened had Neville been the chosen one? I'm convinced Snape would've stayed dark, considering he wasn't in love with Neville's mom and thus wouldn't have had a reason to switch sides. His ""good intentions"" were purely circumstantial and I think he gets way more love and admiration than he deserves. Were he a bit more kind towards Harry, and 11yo who doesn't know Snape at all, instead abusing Harry from the start just because he's James' son, my answer may be different.

harrypotter,"11 January 2023 - In recent years, the wizarding world has seen a steady increase in international trade and commerce, but sources now suggest that this trend is slowing down.

The Ministry of Magic has reported a decrease in the number of import and export licenses issued for wizarding goods and services, indicating a downturn in international trade. This has caused concern among many in the wizarding community, as international trade has become a crucial aspect of the wizarding economy.

Businesses that rely heavily on international trade, such as the magical instrument industry and the potion-making industry, have reported a significant drop in profits. Many merchants have been forced to lay off workers and reduce production as a result of the decrease in demand for their products.

Experts attribute the slowdown in international trade to several factors, including increasing regulations and tariffs imposed by the Ministry of Magic, as well as tensions between different wizarding nations. Some have also pointed to the ongoing war in the Middle East, which has affected trade routes and made it more difficult for merchants to transport goods.

The Ministry of Magic has assured the wizarding community that they are taking steps to address the issue, but many businesses and individuals are calling for more drastic measures to be taken to boost international trade.

In Philosopher’s Stone, Harry faces the book’s challenge with Ron and Hermione; all of his friend’s support. In Chamber of Secrets, Harry faces the challenge with Ron only, having to leave Hermione behind. In a similar fashion, in Prisoner of Askaban, Harry has to face the book’s challenge with only Hermione, having to leave Ron behind. And finally, in Goblet of Fire, Harry faces the challenge completely alone; showing the growth Harry had to go through from  books 1-4. I think also, and this really is my own theory of Rowling’s intentions, that she wanted to show that end to end, Harry had to face Voldemort alone with his own bravery.

harrypotter,"It's pretty common to talk about how Voldemort has chopped up his soul into a bunch of tiny pieces, and how little he would have left- but I think people have missed quite how bad it is.

As I'm sure many remember, you don't just split your soul when you make a Horcrux- you split it when you murder someone in cold blood, as Slughorn tells Riddle here:

&gt;By an act of evil — the supreme act of evil. By committing murder.  
&gt;  
&gt;Killing rips the soul apart. The wizard intent upon creating a Horcrux would  
&gt;  
&gt;use the damage to his advantage: He would encase the torn portion —”

If we take that entirely at face value, things aren't looking very good for Tom's soul. 

Looking at the number of Inferi in the lake, then let's take 150 as the minimum he killed and 1000 as the maximum. Seems about fair. Then, *at best*, he'll have 151-1001 individual pieces of soul. But it's not quite so simple.

In order to find our real answer, we have to decide how a soul tears (though, in sincerity, I *soul-*ly doubt it's meant to be treated so mathematically). Since there's no way with each given murder to know the total number of murders in the future, there's no reason to split an even piece of each time. So likely no perfect 151-1001 part soul. 

If, each time, a chunk just comes off like a sandwich crumb, then he's probably got a bunch of tiny super mini soul bits floating about. Great to resurrect yourself with those.

But. If it's actually cutting off a half each time, and assuming that each half won't be spared future halving in the future, then after 150 murders he'll have 2\^150,  or seventy quattuordecillion (!!!), individual pieces of soul. 7•10\^46. And if it's 1000 murders, then it'll be in almost a centillion, or \~9•10\^302 different parts. Soooooooo yeah. Big numbers. Very big numbers.

That does seem to explain why his soul was so unstable he made a whole accidental Horcrux.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Some alternate scenarios: 

* Voldemort loses a half each time he makes a Horcrux, but murder alone doesn't split his soul in two. Then, he's only got 1/256th remaining.
* Voldemort plans ahead and manages to put about 1/7th in each intentional Horcrux. He still probably ends up splitting the final seventh with Harry, since he gave it up by accident, meaning he and Harry each get 1/14th.
* Peter Pettigrew, when resurrecting him, draws some substantial fraction off of all the Horcruxes, giving him actually a decent restart point.
* Voldemort's soul is no longer a single entity but a sickly buzzing hive of barely connected parts, which no horrible act is even able to damage more.

harrypotter,"Dobby, is practically everyone's favorite character, yet he really gets the short end of the stick in the films. It's like so annoying, and the real reason i could see why they cut him out of the following films we'll discuss, is because they really didn't know any better, or better yet didn't know he would become such a huge and important character later down the line. But is that actually true? By the time the GOF film came out, it was 2005, and the GOF, OOTP, and HBP book already released, and dobby is a prominent character there as well. And when 2007 came about, the books ended and only the OOTP film came out, so why couldn't they have included him in the films before? Is it because they think he's some useless character or something? It's stupid. 

**The Chamber Of Secrets**

Yes, his first appearance to the franchise, really doesn't stick out much. He really just like barely shows up in the film, just in the beginning, middle, and end. Not really much to say here, because even in the book like what does he do? The only thing that really sticks out, is his love of harry tbh. He's so devoted and loyal to him even though he's not even his master, they honestly seem like really good friends, but none of that is really translated in the films tbh. Harry just seems like he doesn't give 2 shits about dobby, and ofc this will become much more apparent later, but even here it feels hfbr3bf yk. 

I also want to talk about his design, and yeah it looks...ugly af. Like i get he's a house elf what more was i expecting, but his design just looks like a wrinkled nutsack tbh. And it's shame they don't have his round glassy tennis ball eyes or whatever. 

Lucius pretty much kills harry and the end of the film, and this is the last we see of dobby, until his eventual demise, but i don't care because he still shows up in the books.

**The Goblet Of Fire**

I remember a while back of something i saw on youtube i think, but it was an easter egg of the GOF film, and in a split second shot you could make it out dobby and winky, during the quidditch world cup scene. And it just makes it even worse why they didn't show up. And i think maybe that's why they didn't want to add dobby? Because they didn't want to have winky? Or something idk i'm really grasping at straws. And it's even more baffling because winky is a great character. Yeah, sure she's an alcoholic mess, but she's really like the driving force for hermione's S.P.E.W obsession and movement. And this scene really shows it.

 *“You may rest assured that she will be punished,” Mr. Crouch added coldly. “M-m-master . . .” Winky stammered, looking up at Mr. Crouch, her eyes brimming with tears. “M-m-master, p-p-please . . .” Mr. Crouch stared back, his face somehow sharpened, each line upon it more deeply etched. There was no pity in his gaze. “Winky has behaved tonight in a manner I would not have believed possible,” he said slowly. “I told her to remain in the tent. I told her to stay there while I went to sort out the trouble. And I find that she disobeyed me. This means clothes.” “No!” shrieked Winky, prostrating herself at Mr. Crouch’s feet. “No, master! Not clothes, not clothes!” Harry knew that the only way to turn a house-elf free was to present it with proper garments. It was pitiful to see the way Winky clutched at her tea towel as she sobbed over Mr. Crouch’s feet. “But she was frightened!” Hermione burst out angrily, glaring at Mr. Crouch. “Your elf ’s scared of heights, and those wizards in masks were levitating people! You can’t blame her for wanting to get out of their way!” Mr. Crouch took a step backward, freeing himself from contact with the elf, whom he was surveying as though she were something filthy and rotten that was contaminating his over-shined shoes. “I have no use for a house-elf who disobeys me,” he said coldly, looking over at Hermione. “I have no use for a servant who forgets what is due to her master, and to her master’s reputation.”*  

She plays such a huge part in the whole crouch storyline, which IMO is really where this book shines. And yes ik this is about dobby, but it feels weird to not at least mention her, because then again, it was because of him she even got a job. But in this book we really see the relationship of him and harry building stronger, especially with the gillyweed.

Okay listen...i get why they cut out him actually giving it, and having neville do it instead, because it made more sense...but it's not like the films made that shit up. That was his original plan in the first place, he wanted harry to ask neville about gillyweed but that failed so he used dobby instead...so why couldn't they just do that instead too? It's like it's the little things that make harry and dobby special yk, even him giving him the stupid sweater he made for him, that's just cute. And even just the fact that again he risked his neck just to help harry, is even better. 

**The Order Of The Phoenix**

Okay replacing dobby with neville last time you had a pass, doing it again nah that's taking it too far. It's like why? Just why? It's so stupid and leaves dobby doing nothing and not even show up in the entire film. And not even just the fact that he doesn't find the room of requirement, nah they take it a step further, and not have him warn harry about umbridge.

 *But he thought he knew — surely only one “she” could induce such fear in Dobby? The elf looked up at him, slightly cross-eyed, and mouthed wordlessly. “Umbridge?” asked Harry, horrified. Dobby nodded, then tried to bang his head off Harry’s knees; Harry held him at bay. “What about her? Dobby — she hasn’t found out about this — about us — about the D.A.?” He read the answer in the elf’s stricken face. His hands held fast by Harry, the elf tried to kick himself and fell to the floor. “Is she coming?” Harry asked quietly. Dobby let out a howl, and began beating his bare feet hard on the floor. “Yes, Harry Potter, yes!” Harry straightened up and looked around at the motionless, terrified people gazing at the thrashing elf. “WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?” Harry bellowed. “RUN!” They all pelted toward the exit at once, forming a scrum at the door, then people burst through; Harry could hear them sprinting along the corridors and hoped they had the sense not to try and make it all the way to their dormitories. It was only ten to nine, if they just took refuge in the library or the Owlery, which were both nearer — “Harry, come on!” shrieked Hermione from the center of the knot of people now fighting to get out. He scooped up Dobby, who was still attempting to do himself serious injury, and ran with the elf in his arms to join the back of the queue. “Dobby — this is an order — get back down to the kitchen with the other elves, and if she asks you whether you warned me, lie and say no!” said Harry. “And I forbid you to hurt yourself!” he added, dropping the elf as he made it over the threshold at last and slamming the door behind him. “Thank you, Harry Potter!” squeaked Dobby, and he streaked off.*  

This is even dumber because now in the film, the entire D.A gets in trouble, whereas in the book they all got off totally unharmed. Which even brings us to very next scene in the film, where they're in dumbledore's office and completely ruin that too. I'm sorry, i'm getting off track the OOTP film is the bane of my existence, and it ruined dobby so it's even worse now.

But oh wait, like GOF this film could't get enough of ruining just one house elf, so they ruined another one...kreacher. I love the fact that harry actually goes to kreacher and asks him if sirius betrayed him, and he doesn't look like a complete idiot for not actually going to check...UNLIKE IN THE FILM! WHERE HE IS. Kreacher is like the complete opposite of dobby, having no respect sirius and pretty much hating his guts. And i understand, he really was the living embodiment of everything he hated with his family's pureblood mania. And even his betrayal is such a crazy ass plot twist, and makes sirius dying even so much more gut-wrenching. And i know this about dobby, but it plays in here too, by removing the character it makes their death much less impactful. Hence, dobby in DH. His death feels unearned and downright cheap and pretty much useless, because all that build-up we had of him and harry's friendship growing and growing over the course of the series, is just completely gone. And at times it also makes him an idiot, like not asking kreacher in the fire about sirius in the film AND...

**The Half-Blood Prince**

Not telling dobby to spy on malfoy. It's literally right there dude, you're so close. Yes, it's not established he even works in hogwarts, but guess what aberforth still called him in malfoy manor, so idk. And i find it hilarious that this homeboy really beat the living hell out of kreacher, and broke some of his teeth because he was talking shit about harry, that's just dedication. 

And that's pretty much all he does for this book...so maybe i'll be lenient and i'll give the film a pass for him cutting him here.

**The Deathly Hallows**

But now reach the penultimate end of whatever idk. Because the films pull a complete 180 and actually include him in the film...YAY but not really. It just feels really rushed and like they're trying to cram in all the missed character moments we had from the books all into 1 scene and it just fails completely, rendering his death scene just completely butchered.

This is honestly one of the best death scenes of the entire series, and it's done beautifully in the book.

 *“Dobby — no — HELP!” Harry bellowed toward the cottage, toward the people moving there. “HELP!”  He did not know or care whether they were wizards or Muggles, friends or foes; all he cared about was that a dark stain was spreading across Dobby’s front, and that he had stretched out his thin arms to Harry with a look of supplication. Harry caught him and laid him sideways on the cool grass. “Dobby, no, don’t die, don’t die —” The elf’s eyes found him, and his lips trembled with the effort to form words. “Harry . . . Potter . . .” And then with a little shudder the elf became quite still, and his eyes were nothing more than great glassy orbs, sprinkled with light from the stars they could not see.* 

Deathly hallows is already a complete bonkers book, with deaths flying left and right and centre, yet dobby's one really just feels like it came out of nowhere and unexpected, and that really adds to the scene rather than take away. I still remember reading the book for one of the first times, and his death really hit me super hard. Like i was literally bawling my eyes out damn. And what's even sadder than him just dying is the scene with his funeral. “

*''There,” she said softly. “Now he could be sleeping.” Harry placed the elf into the grave, arranged his tiny limbs so that he might have been resting, then climbed out and gazed for the last time upon the little body. He forced himself not to break down as he remembered Dumbledore’s funeral, and the rows and rows of golden chairs, and the Minister of Magic in the front row, the recitation of Dumbledore’s achievements, the stateliness of the white marble tomb. He felt that Dobby deserved just as grand a funeral, and yet here the elf lay between bushes in a roughly dug hole. “I think we ought to say something,” piped up Luna. “I’ll go first, shall I?” And as everybody looked at her, she addressed the dead elf at the bottom of the grave. “Thank you so much, Dobby, for rescuing me from that cellar. It’s so unfair that you had to die, when you were so good and brave. I’ll always remember what you did for us. I hope you’re happy now.” She turned and looked expectantly at Ron, who cleared his throat and said in a thick voice, “Yeah . . . thanks, Dobby.” “Thanks,” muttered Dean. Harry swallowed. “Good-bye, Dobby,” he said. It was all he could manage, but Luna had said it all for him. Bill raised his wand, and the pile of earth beside the grave rose up into the air and fell neatly upon it, a small, reddish mound. “D’you mind if I stay here a moment?” he asked the others. They murmured words he did not catch; he felt gentle pats upon his back, and then they all traipsed back toward the cottage, leaving Harry alone beside the elf. He looked around: There were a number of large white stones, smoothed by the sea, marking the edge of the flower beds. He picked up one of the largest and laid it, pillowlike, over the place where Dobby’s head now rested. He then felt in his pocket for a wand. There were two in there. He had forgotten, lost track; he could not now remember whose wands these were; he seemed to remember wrenching them out of someone’s hand. He selected the shorter of the two, which felt friendlier in his hand, and pointed it at the rock. Slowly, under his murmured instruction, deep cuts appeared upon the rock’s surface. He knew that Hermione could have done it more neatly, and probably more quickly, but he wanted to mark the spot as he had wanted to dig the grave. When Harry stood up again, the stone read:* ***HERE LIES DOBBY, A FREE ELF.***  

Just the fact that he thought dobby deserved just as a grand funeral as dumbledore, really speaks to what i've been talking about this entire post, their friendship. That's what really matters, and that magic is really completely lost in the films. Even his last words don't feel earned at all in the films. In the books it's simple, it's just ''harry potter'', because that's all he needed to say, his actions spoke louder. Like him saving harry with the gillyweed, his present with the baubles he presented in the ROR, his crazy ass sweater he gave harry, warning him about umbridge, and even beating up kreacher because he talked shit about his boy, that's dobby, and all of that is lost in the films, and makes his death way less impactful. Both DH films always felt weird to me, in ways i couldn't really articulate, everything just felt, like less impactful and especially the death's. And i now i know why, it's not built up or set up. And that's the problem, you don't build off characters to just have them to die, you develop them first and then kill them, but it just felt the filmakers went the opposite way, and had the intent to kill him first, and didn't care about developing him because they just thought they were going to die in the end, so who cares. It's that level of carelessness that really shows in character's like dobby. And this happens all the time, just read this post again and replace dobby with sirius and it would pretty much be the same, or maybe even lupin too. But for now, it's dobby's turn for the spotlight. 

**In Conclusion**

I always feel like nobody really cared about dobby in the films tbh, like the only time he's actually mentioned is just like how it's better than neville gave him the gillyweed or whatever. But i feel like even in the films too, they really just didn't care about him. And it's not like he's some underrated nothing character, no he's prominent enough to get killed off spectacularly and plays major roles in the last few books. He doesn't get the respect he really deserves man, he honestly deserved so much better. And kreacher too man my god, how come he didn't show up in the end of the battle of hogwarts, such a missed opportunity. But then again, pretty much everything that has to do with dobby is a missed opportunity in the films. Also people who say kreacher had a better character arc than dobby? Like what was dobby's character arc? Huh? He loved harry through and through and really didn't change that much as a character. Whereas kreacher actually changed drastically and went from just hating harry's guts to serving faithfully and lovingly. Not really even related that much, but i just like it had to be said.",Dobby Really Deserved Better In The Films.,1673391091

Fantastic beasts and where to find them

Quidditch through the ages

harrypotter,"Don’t get me wrong all three were very good and solidified how I imagined the book versions of their characters going forward but which one fit their part most? 

I think it comes down to who your favorite character is. For me i thought Rupert Grint was the best cast. 

I thought he was the best of the three in the first couple of movies (“why can’t we follow the butterflies?” cracks me up) and starting with PoA it was about even. Ron was dealt dirty in the movies though and I attribute this to the scriptwriter. 

Harry i think is pretty close to the book version minus the sarcastic quips that were in the book.  We kind of got this in in Half Blood Prince with the Felix Felicis sequence but overall he’s more of a straight man, stereotypical hero character.

For Hermione I think the issue is that the movies made her feel more like Harry’s best friend than Ron did, which again I attribute to the scriptwriter. She also comes across to me as more bossy in the movies than in the books and I don’t know if it’s due to the script or Emma Watson’s direction.

harrypotter,"It's not exactly a secret that Warner Bros has seen better days. Amid a series of massive corporate reshufflings, and a string of unexpected box office flops, WB has made some HUGE decisions in the last year or so. 

While most of the attention has been put on DC, the Wizarding World franchise has also gone through some changes. Most namely, the cancellation of the Fantastic Beasts franchise. Secrets of Dumbledore is at least for now, the last Wizarding World movie, with the last two Fantastic Beasts movies no longer in production. 

However, this begs the question: What can WB do to make this a profitable film franchise again? Well, here is how I think they should go about it. 

**Albus Potter and the Cursed Child**

Now it's not exactly a secret that this project has been in consideration for some time now, however I think it would be the best direction to go. At least for right now. 

While the play was not very good at all (at least IMO), I think that a movie could fix some of the problems. 

I'd go with an entirely new villain, who isn't related to Voldemort or Bellatrix. Someone looking to maybe take the best aspects of Grindelwald and Voldemort and try to accomplish what they couldn't. Maybe, this new villain could be the same age as Albus and Scorpius, allowing for a new dynamic that we haven't seen before. A Wizarding World villain that's the same age as the main characters. 

I would most likely eliminate the time travel plotline, since I think that the time-turners should remain a rare item that's almost never seen. Maybe this idea could be explored in the future, but for a first movie, it's just not a good idea at all. 

Also, this is a no-brainer for me, but I'd bring back the original actors from the first 8 films to play their older selves. And yes, this does include Emma Watson, since it wouldn't make sense for Hermione to be a different race in this franchise. 

This could be the first in a new series of films, or it could be a one-and-done. But after the Fantastic Beasts franchise failed to appeal to casual audiences (and even hardcore fans), I think a big title like this would be the best way to bring attention back to this franchise. Just do what Disney did with Star Wars but do it better than they did. 

**The Marauders**

I'd make this the first TV show of the franchise, following a young James Potter, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew, and their various misadventures at Hogwarts. We could also see a lot of other younger versions of characters, such as Snape, Lily, Lucius, Bellatrix, Narcissa and Regulus. Not to mention all of the professors. 

This could be a much lower stakes show, simply focusing on relationship drama, teen angst and anxiety, and the meaning of friendship. However, we could also see the beginning of the Death Eaters and see a transition into the first Wizarding War against Voldemort. Ideally, I'd have the show end with Voldemort being defeated in Godric's Hollow, Lily and James being killed and Sirius being arrested. 

**The Founders**

This would either be a movie or a mini-series, and would follow the four founders of Hogwarts, and their early struggles with running the school. We'd see how they all first came together, how various aspects of the school were decided, and the eventual falling out between Salazar Slytherin and the rest of the founders. 

If this movie/series is a success, then I would leverage the popularity of it, to make a sequel based on the founding of Ilvermorny in America. I don't think it would be fair to completely ditch the American side of this world, just because of Fantastic Beasts' failure. Speaking of:

**Dumbledore and Grindelwald**

This trilogy would COMPLETELY retcon the Fantastic Beasts' trilogy out of existence and give us the version of this story that we should've gotten in the first place. We get to see Dumbledore's tough upbringing, his relationship/friendship with Grindelwald, and the eventual duel between them and Aberforth that would cost Aurelia her life. 

The second movie would be about Albus travelling the world and making a name for himself, eschewing the naive and bitter personality he would've had in the first film. Grindelwald would meanwhile be building his own band of supporters.

The third film would finally see the famous duel between the pair, ending with Dumbledore detaining his former love and sending him to Azkaban where Voldemort would later find him in Deathly Hallows Part 2. 

**Other possible projects**

* Goblin wars show
* **Young Voldemort movie/show**
* Squib project (about finding purpose despite not being able to use magic)
* **Ministry of Magic/MACUSA show (very political and basically the HP equivalent of Andor)**",How I'd fix the Wizarding World movie franchise,1673385465

harrypotter,"I, personally, feel that Snape and Lily knowing each other was random and just pulled out randomly. I think Rowling could have added a few small hints throughout the books for rereads as she did for the other books' plot twists.

Okay, so now for where I think she could have added a hint. In OotP, Draco Malfoy insults Harry's mother causing Harry to be banned from quidditch by Umbridge. 

\&gt;“Or perhaps,” said Malfoy, leering as he backed away, “you can remember what your mother’s house stank like, Potter, and Weasley’s pigsty reminds you of it —”

I think it would have been cool if Snape was either on the field and reacted after Harry attacked Malfoy of course so the story could continue. Maybe Snape did not stop Malfoy from getting hurt like Harry expected and just stared with a sneer.  Or maybe instead of Snape being on the field,  McGonagall told Snape when Snape asked and Snape gave Malfoy detention.

They found an unpleasant-looking silver instrument, something like a many-legged pair of tweezers, which scuttled up Harry’s arm like a spider when he picked it up, and attempted to puncture his skin. Sirius seized it and smashed it with a heavy book entitled Nature’s Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy. There was a musical box that emitted a faintly sinister, tinkling tune when wound, and they all found themselves becoming curiously weak and sleepy, until Ginny had the sense to slam the lid shut; a heavy locket that none of them could open; a number of ancient seals; and, in a dusty box, an Order of Merlin, First Class, that had been awarded to Sirius’s grandfather for services to the Ministry.

harrypotter,"I've seen the play in San Francisco and read the script. The story is fantastic. It had been 19 years since the Second War. In 19 years, muggles had invented computers that work as phones that fit in our pockets, self-driving cars, etc etc. In 19 years, it's entirely feasible that Time-Turners were reinvented and improved in the wizarding world. Draco is the inventor and despite his character arc in the harry potter stories, we never knew his academic achievements. I can see him being passionate about time travel because he has so many regrets from the past. Hermione is Minister for Magic, of course. Ron works with George at WWW fitting his character. Harry is an Auror, of course. Each of them has grown to become adults in those 19 years, becoming parents, and achieving/giving up on their dreams. They have matured and changed. Most of the opinions hating on the cursed child involve it being ""fan fiction"", the world not following the ""rules"" of the harry potter stories (19 years prior...), and that the characters have changed from their core beliefs (19 years prior...)

It is not ""fan fiction"", it's canon. The author of the story decided that this story was the one that she wanted to include in the canon of the story. It is written by a playwright rather than a young adult fantasy writer. So many of the qualms about the writing or story should simply be because you wanted something different to happen. If Rowling had been the original writer, you would say it was fantastic. The harry potter series is not flawless, there are numerous continuity issues within it regarding the ""rules"" of the wizarding world and the personality of the characters, and she completely caters to the audience she is writing for in the last book, but you do not call that ""fan-fiction"" because she was the writer. 

From 18 years old to 37 years old, most, if not all, people change, drastically. Wisdom is a real thing that occurs over time and each of these characters shows that the way they think is different from being a child. Harry's relationship with Albus is severely strained as many teenager/parent relationships are because the teenager is becoming their own person. 

Delphi being the daughter of Voldemort and Bellatrix is another point of contention. For some reason, people on this subreddit think that Voldemort is incapable or uninterested in sex because it was never mentioned in the harry potter series. Voldemort is a power-crazed dictator who would do anything to survive. He was a psychopath incapable of love or affection. But it is naive to think that sex is attached to love or affection. Sex is a biological function along with any cultural meaning that has been attached to it. Voldemort having sex with Bellatrix is entirely possible, and I would argue is accurate of his character. Bellatrix wanting to have the child of the person she was obsessed with is also a part of her character. It would increase her infamy playing into her ego as the only person to be close enough to the dark lord to have his child. Delphi grew up the same as Harry did. Both parents' true identities were hidden from her, growing up in a house with someone that did not like her, knowing parseltongue, and discovering who she truly was and the prophecy about her in her early teens.

- Grindelwald relied on his skills alone, while Voldemort simply relied on his immortality. Voldemort was very skilled, but he mostly picked enemies much weaker than himself, and tried to avoid his one equally matched wizard (Dumbledore) at all cost. Also Grindelwald managed to subdue the Elder wand, even though he only stole it, while Voldemort didn't.

-Grindelwalds followers were actually loyal to him. They respected him. Only a few Death eaters followed Voldemort out of Loyalty. Most of them followed him, out of fear. That makes Grindelwalds followers much more willing to risk their lives for him, than Voldemorts followers.

harrypotter,"I can't imagine this has never been posted before, but I haven't seen it if it has. But I just love the idea of a Harry and Dudley reunion down the road. 

After the final interaction with the Dursleys, I think we can all agree that Dudley partially redeemed himself. No, it doesn't alleviate all of the mistreatment of Harry over the years alongside Vernon and Petunia. But... He was still a kid when he was extra terrible to Harry and did seem to grow quite a bit after the dementor attack. I'm sure we all were terrible to some degree when we were young, but realizing this and changing for the better (hopefully) is part of growing up, and Dudley seemed to gain some perspective the following couple of years. 

So that brings me to the point of this post: after the amicable farewell between Harry and Dudley in DH, I like to think that the two reunited at some point in the future and even maybe became fond of each other, almost as if they were family... 

I saw a while back a fan fic post about the older crew showing up for Christmas at the Burrow from Mrs. Weasley's loving perspective. In that post, Kreacher was present, indicting a reunion with Harry after the Battle and a positive relationship forming out of an originally negative one. I'd love to see something similar with Harry and Dudley. I know he would probably never want to see Vernon and Petunia again, and vice versa, but I think that Harry and Dudley meeting up at some point and even having children that grew up knowing their cousins on that side of the family would be cool. Even if it was just something short like the above-mentioned fan fic. 

And if we really wanted to break that thang open, what if Dudley had a kid who wound up being a witch or wizard?? I mean... Dudley is related to the Potter side by blood via Lily, so it could definitely happen. I think a storyline where not only do we see the Harry/Dudley relationship develop, but we also see Dudley learning how to deal with being the parent of a wizard after the traumas and upbringing he experienced as a young boy. 

I'm not thinking a drawn out series or anything, just a fun little something something like the Christmas Burrow story. I don't know, maybe there isn't as much to it as I'm thinking, but I think there is some cool/fun potential there.",Dudley reunion?,1673375774

harrypotter,"It comes as no surprise that there is a prejudice between the Wizarding World, and also Muggles. But can you believe that such prejudice could be created by Hogwarts itself? 

Today we're going to look at this topic with another tongue and cheek humor. Lets do this! 

First off we should know that the Wizarding World exist in secret due to the persecutions faced by them during the Middle Ages, and this was when Muggles were feeling that religious fever so to speak. But the interesting thing is as much as Hogwarts was founded to teach the wizarding arts. Salazar Slytherin the founder of House Slytherin wanted Hogwarts to be a school of pure born practitioners to be allowed to practice magic. He even took Godric Gryffindor's tathered hat to create, you guessed it.....The Sorting Hat to of course place prospective students into such houses.

So early on Sly Salazar schemed a tradition that is still used today, even it those intentions are to put it in a better term, ""good"". While later of course Daddy Salazar would leave Hogwarts with intentions of his own and disappear. He would leave behind The Chamber of Secrets for which had a Basalisk to be unleashed to kill off Muggle raised and Half Bloods to make way for those dastardly pure bloods like them annoying Malfoys. 

""But Ferrum you say, Hogwarts was a sanctuary for the Wizards and Witches, it's not that bad.""

While this might be true, even evil is a road paved with good intentions. Keep in mind that while Dumbledore did in fact eventually go on to become headmaster at Hogwarts. Before his time there, as revealed in the Fantastic Beast stories, and Deathly Hallows, him and Grindelwald shared a deep connection to look for those dark relics so they too could become masters of death. While Dumbledore might have wanted nothing but good intentions, his blind devotion to Grindelwald would have him follow such a dark path, making an unbreakable oath, and eventually cause him to duel Grindelwald for the fated Elder Wand. So while he sought to redeem himself, the hunger for power was always there.

Finally lets talk about the deeper secret, The Founding Houses, while competition is all in good fun and humor? Much animosity has always flourished between the Houses. Especially Gryffindor and Slytherin. Examples can be found between James Potter and Snape over Lily. Then you also have Harry and Draco, though in time they do put their differences aside to face Voldemort and the Death Eaters too. The point is rivalry runs deep, and while competition is big for the House Cup. Much of that rivalry still can carry over after the years at Hogwarts. 

So it begs for one to wonder, does Hogwarts and the Houses help influence the Wizarding World? Or consume it from within?

harrypotter,"In HBP after Harry's skull was cracked by McLaggen's bludger, he calls Kreacher to ask him to tail Malfoy. When Harry heard the signature crack of apparition, he saw two elves fighting. Kreacher, AND Dobby.

My question: How did Dobby know that Kreacher was apparating to Harry, and how the hell did he start fighting him mid-apparation? I thought that apparition was near instantaneous, and that no one could apparate next to you unless intentionally using side-along apparition.

Bonus question: In the same scene, Kreacher was insulting Harry, saying that he was friends with blood-traitors and whatnot. This, however contradicts Dobby.  It is revealed by him in GOF that house elves are forbidden to speak their mind about their master without punishing themselves, so how DID Kreacher insult Harry?",How did Dobby apparate with Kreacher to Harry in the hospital wing?,1673365873

harrypotter,"I basically came here to see if anyone else feels this way. As a kid I watched all the Harry Potter movies when they came out, starting from Prizoner of Azkaban (wasn't born before Chamber  of Secrets 💀),  and rematched them countless times at home with my family, especially my mum and my sister. 

I remember reenacting scenes with my sister when we were younger, and even reading the first 3 books as a kid too. Even though I didn't read all of the books, I can confidently say that Harry Potter has been a major part of my life and has always brought joy to me and my family.

Now that I'm older and me and my family have new lives and jobs obviously Harry Potter nights have become much less frequent. We still talk about them from time to time and still love the films but don't watch them nearly as much. 

Now on the rare occasion when I watch a movie, watch a clip of a scene on YouTube from one of the movies, or even listen to some of the scores, I get overwhelmed with emotion and nostalgia and start crying. I miss those moments of acting out scenes when I was younger and waiting for the new movies to come out, Harry Potter brought so much happiness to my life and still does to this day of course.

harrypotter,"In every book some form illegal magic happens around Harry which kind of predicts the main plot of the story.

First one - maybe a bit of a stretch but Hagrid illegally uses his wand to curse Dudley (he even tells Harry not to mention the incident to anyone) after which they go together to Gringotts where the Philosopher's Stone

Second one - Dobby comes to warn Harry about the Chamber of Secrets plot and tell him not to go to Hogwarts. Because Harry refuses, Dobby levitates the cake which prompts the Ministry to send him a warning letter

Third one - Harry runs away from the Dursleys after blowing his aunt and runs into Sirius/Padfoot

Fourth one - Harry almost gets attacked by Ministry employees because someone used his wand to cast the Dark Mark. We later learn that this was Crouch Jr who is working to resurrect Voldemort

Fifth one - Dementors in Little Whinging prompt Harry to cast a Patronus which sets up the conflict between Harry and the Ministry throughout the book

Sixth one - This one is a little bit reversed. Dumbledore comes to pick up Harry to find Slughorn and tells him to have his wand out ready in case but tells him not to worry because he (Harry) is with him (Dumbledore) and then takes Harry on side-along apparition. At the end Dumbledore tells Harry that he is not worried because he is with him and Harry illegally (as he does not yet have an apparition license) takes Dumbledore back to Hogsmeade via side-along apparition

Seventh one - Harry performs a bunch of spells during the battle of the seven Potters despite being underage, but the biggest one is Harry's wand attacking Voldemort, which prompts Voldemort to go on his quest for the Elder Wand

harrypotter,"Also known as Darth Wannabe.

More to the point, I'm referring to a certain minor character from Jim Butcher's famous book series, The Dresden Files, introduced in the short story ""Day Off"" in the compilation book ""Side Jobs"" as the 'antagonist' of what's one of the funniest moment in the entire franchise. And I wanted to know what you think of both this particular story and the series as a whole, since the subject matter is more or less the same and there are many references to Harry Potter in it.

Why, exactly, am I posting this? To elaborate: That series deals with wizards, monsters and magic on a large scale, taking inspiration from all sorts of mythologies and folk stories and even urban legends in very creative ways while still finding a way to be accurate to the source material. And among the hordes of characters inspired by creatures of legend and mythical characters, we have a **very** minor magic talent who Harry Dresden, the main character, derides as a poser and threatens with a revolver.

Especifically, 'Darth Wannabe' is a young ""magic practitioner"" leading his own troupe of Ringwraith reject to get back at Dresden, the eponymous protagonist (Who actually got his name from Houdini, not Potter), 'cause he undid a ""curse"" he cast (Something so minor it was unmade with just some reiki). He tries to be impressive and dramatic, but Dresden calls him and his friends a bunch of tryhards who wears a lot of black, drive a van with goat skulls and inverted crosses painted on the sides and, of course, wear Slytherin scarves and have Dark Marks tattooed on their arms; he even tells them that while he liked the movies, you don't see them going *that* far.

Then, when they challenge to a duel, he tells the Dim Lord and his flying monkeys that if they want to see magic then he can show them some magic. Not by actually casting a spell ('Cause that'd be overkill against those kids), but making the windows on their van disappear with some good ol' gunshots.

Now that you got some context, tell me: If you know of this series, what do you think of it in general and/or compared to this series? I'm sure that you ought to at least have an opinion on stuff like wizardry being nigh completely self-taught, magic having no language for its spellcasting and the presence of characters like The Fair Folk, vampires that are more like their myths portrayed than what modern media says they are, full-blown gods and demons and even belief systems integrated into magic as a whole.

And if you don't, what do you think of this story? And no, the author wasn't actually taking cheap shots at Harry Potter or anything of the sort (And neither am I, for that matter). It's just that, since wizards are more integrated to modern-day civilization compared to wizarding society (Which says a lot, since Dresden wizards can and do live for hundreds of years if given the chance), there HAD to be practitioners of some sort who thought that being a Death Eater would be a good idea. lol",The Dim Lord,1673330685
harrypotter,"I’m sure there’s a book reason for this, but why didn’t Dumbledore just leave Harry his wand (the elder wand) in his will? In Half Blood prince (the movie), after DD dies Harry is seen holding it and every time I see this scene I think “man, he would’ve saved himself so much trouble if he just took it then or snapped it right there.” 

I know that Harry didn’t snap it in the books and I know he didn’t know about the deathly hallows at this point but what I don’t understand is why Dumbledore just didn’t leave him the elder wand since he had already left him the other one ???",Dumbledore’s reasoning for not bequeathing the Elder wand to Harry ?,1673329814
harrypotter,"So I’ve just finished my once a year Harry Potter runthrough and I’ve just been wondering, is it necessary for me to watch the Fantastic Beasts movies as well? Do they expand on the story line, or are they their own seperate arc? I’ve never watched them when they came out in theatres because I didn’t know what they were and I’m very picky lmao. I have HBO and notice that they are on the service as well and want to know if they contribute or if they’re kinda just like their own “meh” arc of the Harry Potter series. TIA",Is watching Fantastic Beasts necessary?,1673327682
harrypotter,"(When I say unrealistic, of course, I mean within the logic of this fantasy world)

I was 18 I think when I read The Order of The Phoenix for the first time and one thing I always found 'odd' was how easily they enter the Ministry of Magic without no one seeing them!

I mean, in the muggle world we have from more basic security systems to more complex and hard to crack ones. 
Cameras, security guards, locks, alarms, etc. And for a public building like that, I expected good security.

Of course, they wouldn't be ""cameras"" there,  but not guard? no magic detectors or alarms? maybe I was expecting some equivalent to our security system somehow. 

Am I the only one who thought this was kinda odd? 

(Apologies for my mistakes, English is not my first language)","What was the ""one thing"" that was unrealistic to you while you were reading the books? For me was the gang infiltrating the Ministry of Magic without being caught",1673327564
harrypotter,"Quick note: this O.C. would be around at least 50-100 years after the events of Harry Potter. 

So I know most of the time, (it feels like) when people make an original character it's a student. but I had an idea for a teacher. This Teacher would teach Care of Magical Creatures and is a Half-Giant and Werewolf. But unlike every other Werewolf he is the first one who can fully control himself. Meaning if for some reason they needed to do a class at night during a full moon. He would be able to 100% no issue. (Just might get a tail wag when you answer correctly)

**Looks:** But Let's see if I can describe him well enough for you to picture them. I want to say he is about 9 feet in height, and very very muscular. I guess think of something between Hulk and Professor Hulk. Black hair in the style of a mohawk, reminiscent to a viking style. And of course he's just hairy all over thanks to the werewolf in him. Has lots of faded tattoos that look like they could be 1, very very detailed and it's just hard to tell now. OR they were just always a mess. A beard in between Hagrids and Dumbledore but tied into one braid. He has one Blue eye and one fully white eye with a nice scar going from the top of that eyebrow to his upper lip, (with a few other scars over his body) and his K9 teeth are always a bit bigger, even when not a werewolf. 

**Clothing**: For clothing he would wear just a harness on around his torso during the hot months were he would have bags attached to keep everything he needs. During the winter months he wears a normal shirt with the sleeves (most of the time) ripped off. 1-3 belts at all time depending on what he needs with him. For bottoms you can see him in some just normal pants, sometimes a fur-like kilt or one year a student got him a pair of super nice Jeans which he only wears if he is going to Hogsmead or on the weekends.

**Personality**: For being so ""rugged"" He takes great care of himself. making sure he never smells (students and teachers say he smells like firewood, a tiny bit of musk with a hint of vanilla. His Voice is deep and with a guttural growl to it. to the point he can scare people if he is not careful. He also knows signed language and teaches it to students who want to learn. to put his personality in a very blunt text. ""Looks like they can kill you, is a cinnamon roll. It's hard to get him upset but you can tell when that happens because he starts to stutter.

**Magical / Abilities:** Despite being a werewolf/half-gaint he is well versed in magic. Seemingly because of all the negative stereotypes put on him, He worked that much harder to overcome them and show people what he is capable of. He is even able to do wandless and wordless magic (though of course not nearly as strong) and can even block a few spells with himself alone. (Remember they needed to hit Hagrid with 4 stun spells before it did anything to him.) While in his werewolf form he is of course much stronger and faster but can't use magic. 

**Weaknesses:** While he works very hard to make sure he comes off nice and approachable some days it can be harder then others. Due to his size and voice he can be scary. to the point normally 1st years avoid him at all costs until a older student or teacher comes in and changes that. As stated before when he gets upset he starts to stutter, and goes until he looses his temper (which is extremely rare) and when that happens he turns into a crying mess. Also While is able to control himself, he knows at one point his werewolf instincts might be to much and that scares him. He is also known to be a bit to confident. Once having to be talked out of being hit with a killing curse because as he put it ""My pecs are so big it would bounce right off"" But that only happens after a few hours of drinking.

**Fun Facts**  
1. He ""owns"" 3 wands. His own and his Mothers, and his grandfathers.  
2. All Wands are inside one wand that is more like a staff to normal people. He rarely uses it however. More or less using ""wandless magic""  
3. His own ""personal"" wand was a 20 inch blackthorn with a dragon heartstring core.  
4. He was in  Gryffindor, but almost was put in Hufflepuff. The shorting hat took a bit trying to choose  
5. He was in the top 10 of his class  
6. Tried to play quidditch but brooms really cant hold that much weight  
7.  Hagrid is a hero to him  
8. He loves to apperate  
9. He wants to try and master fiendfyre but is to nervous to do so.  
10. Before coming teacher he was an Auror.  
11. One time while eating breakfast a bad wizard hit him with a curico curse. He finished his breakfast then calmly walked over to the gun before punching him out cold. Thats one of his more favorite rumors.  
12. During the summer months he takes a bath in the lake. Just be careful going out around midnight.  
13. He lives pretty much in the same spot where Hagrid lived. However his hut is bigger and has more of a ""castle light house"" feel to it.  
14. He is pansexual and has been known to be the ""handsome teacher"" by students and teachers. However if you say anything he turns beat red.  
15. He tries to help in the kitchen, but due to his size really can't and mostly annoys the house elves.  
17.  He swears... a lot  
18. He has a sister (fully human wizard) who works in the M.O.M. Her son goes to Hogwarts.  
19. In between Hogwarts and being an Auror he worked in a more ""adult"" field  
20. He is a candidates to one day become headmaster   
21. He LOVES LOVES LOVES to sing. However he sounds worse then mermaids out of the water.

harrypotter,"Hermione most likely felt insecure about herself in her own way, although not showing it. She most likely felt she was not attractive enough, not funny enough and simply not Ron's tempo. This might be one reason why she was so mad at Fleur all the time. She scowled when she kissed Ron, and was thoroughly foul to Fleur when she stayed at the Burrow. Because Fleur was a born beauty to male eyes from her genes alone. Having been mocked look-wise before, she probably felt that Ron would never choose her. And the fact that she was inherently nerdy while Ron obviously seemed to prefer hanging with more laid-back, outwardly funny and joking styled kids more (not that he didn't like Hermione being around him) probably didn't help.

As for Ron, it's obvious why he was insecure. Krum and Potter. Both of them famous throughout countries. One for being an amazing Quidditch player. One for hoodwinking the dark lord almost every year since he attended Hogwarts, and beating him as a boy. Both were extremely popular and liked by girls (Harry was only really liked after he did something cool, like prove he was right which in the eyes of girls, made him some masculine tough god who was strong and resilient). And, as Hermione's other best friend, both were on equal terms with Hermione, so he wouldn't really have a head start on her if it became a race to see who could charm her.

So in the end, both were just so blinded by the negative mindset of ""oh, they're gonna want someone else"" that they couldn't realize that the ""competition"" they had wasn't even real. Krum was more of a friend/experimental relationship than a long-term partner. Harry showed no signs of romantic affection for Hermione and likewise. And Fleur was more of eye-candy to Ron than someone he'd actually date in the future. Both actually liked each other, but couldn't even see it.",I thoroughly enjoyed how Ron and Hermione always liked each other but were too insecure and jealous to see it,1673324332

harrypotter,"Currently rereading the books after having only read them when I was very young, and something has become glaringly obvious; Harry Potter is a stupid child who is too proud for his own good. 

It’s obvious that it’s because he is young and stupid, thinking he always knows right because that’s what teenagers do. But because the movies follow an actor who ages 2-3 years between each movie that only has a 1 year gap, it feels like Harry is more mature in the 4th movie onwards. Radcliffe also acts older in his delivery and I can’t help but feel like they probably wrote the movies that way to make him sound more his own age. 

It’s not until you read the book when you realize that Harry Potter is painfully young. So young that I’ve been yelling in my head about things that happen in the 4th and 5th books simply because if he just wasn’t such a proud little brat, things would be so much easier for everyone. He could tell the truth, speak, and ask questions, but having watched the movies for so long, I’ve forgotten how young he is and how undeveloped that makes his brain. Hermione acts like the only sane person in a group of idiots, being the only voice of reason for a grown up reader which is a nice way to grasp some sense of sanity when I’m reading a young teen make bafflingly accurate decisions for someone his age.","It’s very easy to forget how young Harry is supposed to be in the movies, but NOT in the books",1673318875

harrypotter,"As many of you know, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child recently made its return to major theatre areas around the world. This new version of the play was only one part as opposed to two, cut around 1.5 hours worth of story, and features a new love story. I never saw the original version of the play, but I did read the script... and like a lot of people, I truly hated most of what I read. The characterizations of everyone were terrible, the constant usage of nostalgia felt off-putting, and the idea that Cedric Diggory was an important-enough character to warrant the entire ""eighth story"" in the HP being about him was just so weird. I didn't have any plans to see this on the stage and thought that was the end.

But this month, a family member of mine, who's a big fan of Harry Potter, got tickets to see this new version of the story. I was invited to watch it as well, so I attended the show in Toronto. I said to myself, even though I didn't like the script, I wanted to keep an open mind about what I was about to watch. Even with my problems with the story, I was intrigued by how the crew would pull off the production/magic stuff. 

I sat in my seat, the lights went down, and for 3 hours and 20 minutes, I was... incredibly disappointed. This story just does not work. In every sense of it, this story falters completely. The pacing is terrible, the dialogue is atrocious, Harry Potter is an absolutely terrible father despite nothing in the previous stories pointing to this becoming a possibility, most female characters are shafted completely then reappear randomly (Ginny, Rose, and even Hermoine), Ron gets nothing to do, Delphi is without-a-doubt the worst villain in the franchise, and the usage of Voldemort, Snape, and Cedric had my rolling my eyes. Somehow, the show felt jarringly fast and incredibly slow at the same time. In order to save time from the previous version, the first 20 minutes feel like an F1 race on steroids before coming to a screeching halt to actually set up the story, which again, is so boring and pretty confusing to keep up with. 

The saving grace of this new version is Albus and Scorpius' love story, which is a new addition. Despite not getting nearly enough time to actually explore their relationship, they were just adorable together, but nothing more. Honestly, if you do without all the bigger Harry Potter stuff, this story between the two young men would be a fairly standard, and enjoyable rom-com. But no, we have to get a story about Harry constantly going after Albus and Albus acting like the worst teenager to ever exist. 

I don't know if it's Jack Thorne, Rowling, or whoever else was involved in the writing of both versions of this story, but it's just awful. This should've probably been a movie to begin with, as then they could at least pull this thing off visually, but even then, after reading the script, I'd say kill it with fire. 

The actual production of the play was solid, with the crew using pretty cool optical illusions and practical effects to pull off the magic of the universe. But after a while, you'll find yourself wondering about how something would've and could've looked better if this was just a movie or TV show. There are just certain things in the HP universe that don't work on stage... mainly, WIZARD SPELLS. 

I'm all for supporting stage productions, but this one is just bad. I guess it's a saving grace that I saw the 3-hour version instead of the 5... because if I almost fell asleep during the Toronto production, who knows what would've happened in the London production. 

And just one more thing... none of this has anything to do with the cast. If any of you come across this post, know that none of you are the problem with this show and you all did a fine job. The writing is not nearly up to par with your acting skills.",I recently watched the revised version of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child and I have a lot of thoughts...,1673309785
harrypotter,"Just curious really. If anything I would of liked to seen a bit more of the other characters time to shine. Like maybe a chapter where we go from Neville to Ginny to someone else just to see them fight and stuff.

harrypotter,"Rumours about a reboot don't really surprise me every major franchise gets remade or rebooted sooner or later and I'm actually surprised it took this long. My main worries about them rebooting the series is firstly if they decide to make new movies I feel not enough time has passed and the 8 movies we got were good solid adaptations and I think new movies won't be as good and will receive the same complaints people have for the other movies about stuff that gets left out.

Now as many people have said a tv series would be the perfect way to go about it and be able to be more faithful to the books. My biggest worry however is will the people who work on a potential series be passionate about making a faithful adaptation of these stories because I could totally see them wanting to put their own stamp on the series and make a lot of unnecessary changes to make it completely different from the books and movies. Also given Warner Bros handling of major franchises in recent years it leaves me less than confident about how they would go about any sort of reboot.

harrypotter,"Magical evolution theory suggests that given what we know about the magical world, it is likely if not inevitable that the magical world will engulf the muggle world. The main points I will use to prove this will be population, politics and human nature because at the end of the day wizards are human too.


To start with we know that the population of witches and wizards is low during the events of the books. After dealing with the magical wars, two by voldemort and one grindlewald, there is likely to be a baby boom just like with our world after world war 2. Because of the acceptance of muggle born witch and wizards into wizarding society the population will soon ovwrtake muggles. We don't know the rates at which these people are born but given how many appear in the books I think it is fair to say the numbers are significant and only going to rise. 

An argument against this is the birth of squibs or non magical people born to magical family's. However I would argue that there is clear evidence that these people are likely to stay in the wizarding world. Filch is evidence that squibs are not kicked out of society, given how prejudiced the wizarding community is shown to be I'm sure that most squibs are treated as second class citizens, but I would say they are still more likely to stay in the wizarding world this I'd because they are not likely to leave to the almost alien muggle world. Arthur Weasley who is meant to work in the field of muggles is fascinated by simply things like the underground escalator and a rubber duck. The average wizard is going to be terrified at the idea of joining the muggle world. I would also say that life for squibs in the wizarding world is likely to get better again proved by Flitch working at one of the most prestigious wizarding school in the world. We are also shown that the younger generations are much more progressive when it comes to non magical people showing again that life will improve as the years pass. Plus there is the improvement to life that comes with living inside a magical world even without magic, bewitched items to make life easier would surely make even people without magic want to stay. 

Another point against my theory is that the magical world is just more dangerous, so the numbers of population will not grow. Jobs like inventing magic potions and caring for dangerous magical creatures and plants. But to this I would say these jobs are more likely to be few and far between rather than the norm. The magical world must have stores, restaurants and business of all kinds. Just like in the muggle world most jobs are likely to be safe. Even with the dangous jobs it is clear that health care in the wizarding world is much better than the muggle with people living much longer and being healed from most injuries and illnesses. 

Now if you accept my point that the population will rise through the decades then I believe this would bring in many changes for the wizarding world namely lack of jobs. With magic the jobsof ten people can be done with one spell and with better health care and easy work, just casing spells the age and amount of people retiring is like to go down substantially. This will make more witches and wizards poorer and dangling on the poverty line. Also as the population grows space will come at a premium. We have seen that magic can do strange things with space (tent at quidditch world cup) but even with this there is only so much space and so much money to buy the available space to go around. This will push poor and poorer witches and wizards closer and closer to the muggle world with poor people almost rubbing shoulders with muggles. 

I  belive this will all come to a head with poor witch's and wizards being becoming poorer and angrier and angrier. I belive it wouldn't take much, a charismatic smooth talking dark witch or wizard, to use this unrest. They could to work their way up the political system to be voted minister of magic. They could then use this position with the backing of the people to start a war with the muggle world for space and control of the planet. This dark Lord would be different than any that came before as unlike Voldemort this person would have the backing of a country and more legitimacy. 

I know what your thinking, earlier I argued that the wizarding world is getting more progressive now I'm say there is going to be a war with them. The difference is I didn't say which ministry was going to war. It is clear that there are a great many. There is the British one in the main books then there is an American ministry, who is to say there is not a great many ministries just like in the muggle world, all with different ideas and ideals of how the world should work just like in this world. But it just takes one of them to be corrupted by a dark wizard or by bad politics for a war to start. 

In closing I belive this is inevitable as the population grows and poor people are squeezed more and more, hiding will seem almost pointless, the liklihood goes up and up as population rises. We know there are many dark wizards who could easily use this tension to rise up and exercise power, the angrier the people are the easier it will be to turn the anger on to an ""other"" in this case muggles. But there will still be progressive wizards and a progressive ministry who will fight to save muggles but this will most likely, with the massive number of wizards, lead to the unveiling of the wizarding world. The outcome of the war in my mind is irrelevant, as soon as it starts the wizarding world is over and it is just the world with whole new challenges of co habition.

I belive the only thing that could stop this outcome are more magical wars, if the wizarding world can't come together and get along long enough for their numbers to grow they can't outnumber muggles. If the magical community doesn't progress as is expected and doesn't become more welcoming to non magical people like squibs and muggleborns and pushes them out of the magical world and into the muggle one then the overpopulation won't happen as quickly or at all.

2- I want to watch how were Sirius and Andromeda kicked out. Frame by frame, show me the drama!

3- The engagement between Bellatrix and Rodolphus, and then Narcissa and Lucius. Did they try to find someone for Andromeda before she left? For Sirius and Regulus?

4- Voldemort's influence in the house. As far as I remember, he was growing in power and influence as Bellatrix was finishing Hogwarts. Her family believed in Voldemort's ideas. But what was it like?

harrypotter,"Hot off the latest Xmas rewatch, I've been on a Potter bender.

One thing that stood out to me in this rewatch was Harry's emotional evolution and how expertly it's handled. I particularly love Harry's choices in Prisoner of Azkaban. See, a complaint about Harry Potter is that if he would just tell the adults AKA Dumbledore what's going on, a lot of problems would be solved. However, Book 3 really presents a plausible reason for Harry to not be able to share what he knows with Dumbledore, as Sirius is at first a personal vendetta Harry feels some shame for, and later as a fugitive, Harry can't fully expose Sirius.

Then, by the time Harry realizes he really just needs to tell Dumbledore what's up, the headmaster becomes a fugitive. Then, he dies.

So this question of ""Just tell the adults what you know"" becomes complicated very very quickly.

Now let's consider why Harry is the ""Boy who lived"". As he says, even up until Order of the Phoenix, his phenomenal 3/3 record against Voldemort is due to luck, help and unknown factors. He of all people, worthy because of confronting fear and danger courageously, nevertheless admits that his success is not in any way a product of his own skill or power.

Harry lived because of Lily's old magic spell. That was broken by Voldemort's deep spell. Azkaban, the only book where Harry did not confront Voldemort, features a telling prophecy, and the events surrounding Pettigrew. I suspect there is a link between the prophecy and the intention of Voldemort. In the magical world, powerful wizards shape events which become spells. These are mirrored by prophecies which become more true as the spells grow in power. Understand?

In the book ""Johnathan Strange and Mr. Norrell"" there are two gentlemen of England, who many years after the disappearance of magic, are somehow able to do it again. In the end, a strange and seemingly minor encounter with a malicious fey folk becomes a massive set of spells that changes England. It turns out this seemingly random, malicious fey might have been connected to the great master of English magic since Merlin, the Raven King. The random events circumscribing the lives of Johnathan Strange and Mr. Norrell turn out to be products of a weird and wonderfully planned spell by the Raven King to trick and defeat this powerful and evil fairy. The fairy is totally tricked, almost up to the level in which Eru Iluvatar tricks and defeats Sauron by using the curse of his own magic to - through Gollum by way of the kindness of Frodo - curse the Ring to meet its own demise.

I am completely certain, through Deathly Hallows, that Dumbledore used the Deathly Hallows - a very vague, mysterious, and tangentially but mysteriously powerful magic - to complete a spell he had been casting for many years. Harry Potter was merely a lucky ingredient of the spell to defeat Voldemort. Yes, Voldemort was defeated because of a masterful, god-tier advanced spell of Dumbledore in which Harry was a mere ingredient.

Thus, in this interpretation of advanced magic where manipulating people and events and incorporating varieties of magic produces strong and unimpeachable results, Slytherin House was made part of Hogwarts.

We easily forget the emblem of Ravenclaw isn't - lol - a raven. It's an Eagle. This is an imperial emblem. The lion is regal. The badger is defiant. The snake is something else.

Hogwarts is not merely a school. It is a spell cast upon English magic. It is as profound as the spell of the Raven King. It affects all English magic, and resonates through the wider world due to England's connection to old magic.

It's not that Slytherin is tolerated. Slytherin is part of the spell. The Basilisk was the spell's concession to Salazar. Yes, of course Slytherin is evil. But Hogwarts is a spell meant to drive a line between the muggle and magical worlds. To protect BOTH of them, and allow wizards to deal with the arcane and dangerous elements of the magical universe (goblins, beasts, elves, etc.)

Thus we must not think of Slytherin as evil. Instead. We must become part of the spell, the legacy of Merlin. We must be grateful that magic and muggle are regulated and put in order, for the benefit of both.

The topic of what muggles might do to the magical world is fascinating. It invokes the concept of ""before"" old magic. Of a magic that muggles can invoke, the grand and greater spells. Magic can't make food or gold. The mundane and profane can. Science is like a sweeping uber-magic. It's universal common sense. Plato's forms, shared by all to no one's benefit unless they are universally obeyed. Where the wizard can refuse to obey, the muggle must. But, the muggle, in obeying, might gain a greater power.

I have never been a fan of David Yates. He ruined OotP for me by cutting out a lot of the scenes that really showcased Harry's growth as a character. I've always thought that the odd-numbered installments in HP (with the exception of Deathly Hallows) were more about character development and how everything was affecting him, while the even-numbered installments were more story-driven. Yet Yates cut most of those scenes out, and pulled a lot of punches (i.e. muting Harry's scream when Sirius falls through the veil and not having him lash out at Dumbledore the way he did in the book). And where the hell was the scene where it was revealed that Umbridge (who was nowhere near as sadistic as she was in the book) ordered the dementor attack on Harry? The only thing I was impressed by was his adapting the longest book in the series into the shortest film, but I think they could have made an alternate cut of the film with some of the scenes that were left on the cutting room floor being added and some of the existing scenes being cut which would be roughly the same length.

He got better with the subsequent films (possibly due to Steve Kloves returning as screenwriter) but they still weren't as good IMO as the first four films. I know that politics play a significant part in the story, but the tone of Yates's later films is a little too political IMO. Combining the politics with the way in which most of the characters are dressed in the later films hardly makes it seem like a fantasy film about wizards at all.

I don't agree with the stuff that JKR has said in recent years, but I think she's a good writer, and I think Steve Kloves is a good screenwriter. But David Yates is not a good director for the Wizarding World franchise because he doesn't know which scenes are essential to the story and which ones can be cut or re-worked. Also, Yates went from directing low-budget, made-for-TV movies to one of the largest franchises of all time without any stepping stones in between. Chris Columbus had ""Home Alone"", Alfonso had ""A Little Princess"", Mike Newell had ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" as well as an extensive resume dating back to the 1960s (I don't think his ""Bollywood"" direction style would have worked for most of the films but it worked for GoF), and Yates? The previous film he directed before OotP was ""The Girl in the Cafe"", and all of his films were either TV movies or shorts. Outside of the UK he was practically unknown. So he was an odd choice of director IMO.

I still think they have a shot at steering the FB franchise in the right direction but they need to get the right person for the job.","What if the reason why the FB series failed isn't because of JKR and the writers, but because of David Yates?",1673215994

harrypotter,"I decided to read through the HP books for the first time in many years, taking notes about various things as I did so to keep track of everything.

One of those things is the locations of various places within Hogwarts and, more specifically to this post, the entrance to the Gryffindor common room. I'd gotten the majority of the way through the first book believing that the entrance to the Gryffindor Tower was through a hole behind the portrait of the Fat Lady at the end of a corridor on the second floor.

My reason for thinking it's on the second floor is from a few pieces of evidence:

* When Percy first leads them to the common room from the Sorting Ceremony's feast, they climb multiple staircases - that puts it on a floor higher than floor 1 (i.e. at least floor 2).
* When going back to the common room after defeating the troll in the girls' toilet (which I believe is on the ground floor), Ron and Harry don't talk until they've climbed two floors up. Then a brief conversation is described and they reach the common room. From this quote, it's possible for the entrance to be more than two floors up, but I think it's implied to be on the second floor, and it's definitely not lower than the second floor.
* When going to the trophy room to duel Malfoy, they went up a staircase to the third floor. Now, even if there were more than just this one staircase (which isn't implied), this means that it's definitely below floor 3.

If it's at least as high as the second floor and lower than the third floor, it must be on the second floor - there's no other option.

Nothing contradicted this throughout the book, so I held fast to my belief. Until they sneak out at night to the forbidden third-floor corridor to stop ""Snape"" from stealing the Philosopher's stone. In this instance, they go up two sets of stairs - the first of which Mrs Norris is skulking at the top of and they climb around her, the second of which, which is mentioned as ""the staircase up to the third floor"", Peeves is floating halfway up.

I was a bit confused by the contradiction to what I thought was the truth, so I googled for the location of the Gryffindor common room. Imagine my surprise when all the sites say it's on the seventh floor! 

I looked at what the source for that is, and the wiki says ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game)."" Are the video games really the accepted source of canon over the books? Or is this backed up elsewhere in later books?

I'm going to note down the contradiction I found as a potential plot hole or potential for a strange Hogwarts layout (e.g. the first corridor led to a balcony halfway up the second floor and the second corridor led the rest of the way up to the third floor) and keep making notes as I read to try and figure it out. But the thing with the seventh floor is just crazy imo, since there are at least two quotes showing them going upwards from the common room to the third floor.

harrypotter,"I’ve been rewatching the Harry Potter films recently and beside the fact I think there are a lot of issues with how jk wrote and told the story of character’s one who I always will think is unfairly hard done by and wasted is Draco.

Jk Rowling should of written a book showing the life of Draco and his mother, by how their relationship and the lestrange family seem I’d think that Narcissus marriage to Lucius was arranged and abusive and that part of Dracos horrible attitude came from his home life and how his father was horrible to him and his mother. 
Rowling should of written a book showing a pov of Dracos home life and maybe even including how his mother and father met. Rowling then should of showed different areas of Draco’s life leading up to half blood Prince which then goes into Dracos battle with wanting to be good but being in a situation where he’s forced to be bad.

A book like this could of been really interesting and given Dracos character the depth it really needed.
However all in all I hate Dracos ending anyway I think a much better ending would be if at the end of half blood Prince he chose not to kill Dumbledoor by his own choice not Snape stopping him and then joined the order leading him to help out in deathly hallows and maybe once again in his own book showing the effects of him being a Slytherin who turned good!",Jk Rowling should of made a separate Draco Malfoy book showing his pov.,1673215274

An example of this is how the trio end up at the shrieking shack. They didn't follow clues to catch Sirius Black like they would have in the previous writing style, In fact they only end up in the shrieking shack because Hermiones cat chased Scabbers/Peter to the womping willow.

harrypotter,"... and boy did it raise a lot of questions. However, I'll just post 2 here:

1] Do wizards have no due process at all? Percival Graves just gets to make an instant, one-man decision on the death penalty, and everyone is down with it? Like, it must happen a lot since a) the American ministry has its own built-in execution chamber, and b) everyone - including Tina's coworkers - is just cool with putting her down immediately. 

Moreover, do these people not consider themselves Americans *even slightly?* They're surrounded by normal humans whose entire country is built around a notion of established and inalienable human rights. But their little sect has no rights at all? They're SO removed from muggles that their system is tantamount to a rule-by-fiat dictatorship?

2] Why haven't wizards taken over the world? In the books, magic seemed, if not quite trivial, then at least relatively on-par with the power of one-man technology. This is to say that a single wizard couldn't utter a few words and set off the equivalent of a nuclear bomb. Even when Voldemort and Co. blew up a bridge, that appeared to be a) an extremely impressive feat, and b) a group effort by the Death Eaters.

In Magical Beasts, not only are single wizards essentially wordlessly shattering buildings, but it's pretty clear that average American Aurors are just amble to effortlessly reassemble said destruction in seconds. 

Moreover, we know from the books that even a lot of wizards who AREN'T Death Eaters consider themselves to be superior to the rest of humanity. So you have this subset of elitist super-beings, many of whom think they've transcended humanity, and...

harrypotter,"Hottake: The way most people understand the house system is wrong. The way most people seem to think it works is like star signs, where you get a full batch of personality traits that you need to adhere to, most of them being subject to fairly substantial change in a normal human ages 11 to 17. 
 Due to this, a lot of people decry the house system as impractical, and bad, something that I am inclined to agree with 
HOWEVER, I don’t think that this is how it was intended, at least not by the founders of Hogwarts. 
 In the legend of the Secret Chamber, McGonnagal tells us about the founding of Hogwarts. She says that the founders couldn’t agree on which students to teach, so they all taught their own houses. Slytherin wanted to teach purebloods, so to get into Slytherin you needed to be a pureblood. To get into Ravenclaw you needed to hold knowledge as the highest virtue, to get into Gryffindor you needed to be exceptionally brave, and Hufflepuff took the rest. 
 This interpretation is way more practical from the viewpoint of the founders, as it solves their original problem.
The different personality traits that are assigned to the houses, I think are prejudices that evolved later: Samrt people are awkward eggheads, Brave people reckless jocks, etc. Being a stereotype for your house was never an intended requirement to get in. 
 Now I realise, that the legend is the only confirmation we have of this interpretation, but I at least think that this is the version that makes the most sense.","The house system has been completely misunderstood, and retconned!",1673188675

I’ve seen discussions that people think Crouch was being overly mean during the DADA lesson while showcasing Cruciatus but it also seems like Moody is there at the end and genuinely concerned for showing that to Neville given he knows about his parents. 

2. When he transfigured Draco it also seemed like he was acting as Moody, someone I’m assuming wasn’t a huge fan of Lucius, as he’s yelling about telling him stories that would curl even his greasy hair lmao

During one of the DA meetings, Ron and Hermione are ""opponents"" as the other members stand around to watch. The Weasley twins make a bet, yet I couldn't decipher which one of the brothers would bet against Ron and which against Hermione.

My original thought was that George betted against Hermione, whereas Fred against Ron. In the books it is clear that George can be seen as somewhat more of the empathic brother, I feel like he might as well have more faith in Ron then Fred would have, who was rumored to end up with Hermione before the original ending of the series.

I wondered how others perceived this scene, for it was not in the books.

Maybe it's the Ravenclaw in me, but I would absolutely love to do some data analysis to look for correlations and relationships between people's houses, wand types, patronuses, and other information.

If you'd like to participate, please comment your wizarding world information (house, wand, and patronus), as well as any other information you'd like to (but you dont have to) include, like your gender identity, Myers-Briggs type, where you're from (state or country), etc.

For example, here's mine:
- House: Ravenclaw
- Wand: Hawthorn, Phoenix Feather, 11 3/4 inches, unyielding
- Patronus: Siberian Cat
- Gender Identity: Female
- Myers-Briggs Type: ISFJ
- Where I'm From: Wisconsin, USA

The only thing I ask is that you only comment your official wizarding world results, not which house/wand/patronus you'd like to have. And please don't comment your results if you knowingly answered dishonestly to get the result you wanted, just because I want to keep the data as accurate as possible.

I'll need quite a few people to comment in order to get a large enough sample size, so even if you dont want to participate, if you could at least upvote this thread so more people will see it, I'd appreciate it.

Thank you!!

P.S. I'll definitely be posting an update with the results if i end up getting enough responses to have a big enough sample size to do an analysis.","Please comment your house, wand, and patronus so I can do a little data analysis",1673107536

harrypotter,"Specifically, about the prophecy. I would've written about it in my previous thread about it (see here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/sxz2pn/in\_harry\_potter\_do\_the\_prophecies\_all\_come\_true/](https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/sxz2pn/in_harry_potter_do_the_prophecies_all_come_true/)) but it was locked, so I'm making a new one. 

The prophecy was to be fulfilled, of that I'm almost certain for two reasons: 

1) Dumbledore lied to him about the fact that he must die in order to destroy the last horcrux inside of him, something it was certainly needed to fulfill the prophecy. Dumbledore in ""Half-Blood prince"" tries to convince Harry of the importance of acting of his own free will, but this must be surely because, being a very smart man, he knew Harry would've acted against it at the last moment, and reassuring him he must choose himself ensures him the prophecy, not the headmaster, will correct Harry's path. Don't forget that Dumbledore's plan was for Harry to fight Voldemort AFTER destroying all the horcruxes, while we all know the snake was still alive at the time. 

2) For me, at the last duel of Harry v Voldemort, the clue that the prophecy was in action was the fact the Elder Wand belonged to Harry. In the hands of Voldemort, it wouldn't have worked. Especially because Harry didn't intend to kill Voldemort. Instead, the Avada Kedavra made by Voldemort rebounded, but it all acted automatically, after the prophecy set things in motion. Chance wasn't there at that duel.

He fought Dumbledore and judging from the film, Dumbledore didn’t have problems facing someone holding the wand.  Dumbledore fought Voldemort using the wand at the ministry and impression’s are, what the difference with a wand that everyone’s using?

As for Dumbledore, this is even dumber. Yeah, I know there's a magical contract (and it makes NO sense how a magical object that's meant to choose 17+ year olds for a inter-school contest would create a magical contract that's above Dumbledore's magical powers to destroy/change it), but the contract never stopped Harry from cheating, or anyone else from cheating, at that. And obviously, playing fair in a competition that's reward is fame and 1000 galleons to the winner, is nothing compared to the grand plan of stopping the greatest Dark Wizard who seeks to put the world under his foot.

So why, may I ask, did Dumbledore not take every measure necessary to ensure Harry's safety. The kid could've died several times over (he almost got slammed by a Horntail's tail in the movie and got slashed in the arm in the books). If I was Dumbledore, I'd be taking no risks and be secretly giving him info from the sidelines. Heck, I'd even manipulate the competition while it unfolds to ensure his safety (come on, he's the greatest Wizard to live, there's no way that he'd be unable to hoodwink some Ministry officials and a bunch of teenagers to help Harry cheat). As for Snape, you'd think he'd convey some handy tips to someone else who'd convey it then, to Harry. He's been anonymously watching Harry from the sidelines and it's stupid how he'd be willing to take such a gamble on Lily's sake on something so dangerous. Crazy how a Death Eater who wanted Harry dead ended up ensuring Harry's safety in the tournament more than people who had to keep him alive to destroy the Dark Lord.",Why didn't Dumbledore and Snape help Harry cheat,1673062975

harrypotter,"The series ends with the words “All was well”. But how can it be that all was well if nothing essentially changed after the defeat of Voldemort? 

The wizarding world is extremely racist towards every other sentient magical race (goblins, elves, merpeople, centaurs, giants, etc). Such a world allowed the Ministry of Magic to be formed, which constantly abuses its power and benefits from said racism (mainly via goblins and elves), while preventing all other races from using wands and thus maintaining their hegemony. It is out of that system that somebody like Voldemort rose to power and if you think about it nothing essentially changed after he was defeated. There were no systemic changes in their world that could prevent something like that happening again. And Voldemort really isn’t that much worse from the majority of other wizards, he is just more extreme and his racism extends to muggles and muggle-borns as well. 

After Rowling introduced elements to the world such as slavery or the goblin rebellions (in which the goblins had a violent uprising protesting against their mistreatment by wizards), defeating Voldemort simply isn’t a satisfying enough ending. 

Yet, none of the characters seem to care that the world is so broken. You would expect Harry to be a bit more empathetic considering he grew up in the muggle world and should thus not be desensitized but shocked at the inequality of this new world, yet he doesn’t care at all. When he finds out that Slughorn has been testing poisons on house elves his first thought it how annoyed Hermione would be. And the entire resolution to the slavery plot line is that elves enjoy being slaves. What the hell?

Rowling seems to think that just because Harry and Hermione now work for the ministry that everything is fine, when that would be impossible because the same broken systems still exist.",Why doesn’t a single character in the books care that the wizarding world is so broken and racist?,1673059585

harrypotter,"This is completely inspired by /u/[SaraSmile416] and her retelling of the Harry Potter series written from Hermione’s perspective. I am currently reading her version of Prisoner of Azkaban (which is so far, the most gripping fanfic I have ever read) and it got me thinking: what if there was an entry for each book in the series featuring a different character? I thought it might be fun to outline some of my ideas and which story elements could be included in each book. Enjoy!

Book 1: 
Ron Weasley and the Black Knight
-the troll attack
-the Mirror of Erised
-sneaking off to Hagrid’s and Norbert
-the third floor corridor
-his giant chess game 

Book 2:
Ginny Weasley and the Secret Diary
-the diary, of course
-being possessed
-encounter with the Malfoy’s
-navigating her first year classes with students in her house whom we’ve never met (such as a young Luna Lovegood?)
-her heavy crush on Harry Potter
-encounters Moaning Myrtle
-the Chamber of Secrets

Book 3:
Hermione Granger and the Time Turner
This one has already been done justice, albeit with the title, “Hermione Granger and the Prisoner of Azkaban” thanks to SaraSmile416. Her primary storyline goes into great detail on the time turner and the emotional stress it puts on Hermione as she tries to keep everything in order, as well as the toll it takes on her friendships with Harry and Ron, Ginny, and a few others (I won’t spoil too much). Seriously, read it if you like the concept!

Book 4:
Fred and George Weasley and the Faux Galleons (Idk about that title, help me!)
-Ludo Bagman storyline
-Quidditch World Cup and the death eater attack
-attempt on the Goblet of Fire
-experimenting with their joke toys and candies
-starting their Wizard Wheezes business
-witnessing/betting on the tournament
-obtaining the galleons from Harry

Book 5:
Luna Lovegood and the Veil of Mysteries
-meeting Harry Potter
-friendship with Ginny and Neville
-being an outsider in the Ravenclaw house
-the Quibbler
-joining Dumbledore’s Army
-producing a patronus
-thestrals
-adventures in the department of mysteries

Book 6:
Draco Malfoy and the Vanishing Cabinet
-father going to prison
-his task given by Voldemort
-exploring his relationship with Narcissa
-petrifying Harry on the Hogwarts Express
-attempts on Dumbledore’s life (such the necklace and the wine bottle)
-sneaking into Slughorns party
-relationship with Snape
-inner turmoil with realizing he is not the person he thought he was
-Sectumsempra curse
-Mending the cabinet

Book 7:
Neville Longbottom and the Sword of Gryffindor
-Bill and Fleur’s wedding
-going to Hogwarts under Snape as headmaster
-dealing with the Carrows
-growing as a leader and person
-friendships with Ginny and Luna
-bringing Dumbledore’s Army back
-alliance with Aberforth Dumbledore
-Luna being taken by Death eaters
-the battle of Hogwarts
-pulling the sword out of the hat

Harry’s first prediction is that he will have a risk of getting burnt, the first task involved dragons. Ron’s prediction was that he would lose something most cherished, the second task ended up, having Ron kidnapped as as Harry’s most prized possession by the influence of mercury, Mercury = merpeople. The third prediction involved Harry getting betrayed by someone he thought as a friend,this could represent two things, Viktor Krum’s betrayal in the maze, or more importantly, Mad Eye Moody’s “betrayal” in disguise by Barty Crouch Junior. Harry thought of Moody as a mentor and helper by the end. The final prediction before they continued their homework, Harry says that he will come out worse in a fight at the end.

harrypotter,"It's something the fandom is tackling pretty well, I think. Even though, I think dragons would probably be extincted if there were that much dragonhide armour created in the second war against Voldemort.

However, dragonhide may be tough but it's only like a unenchantable thick plate of steel. What about reactive armour with layers which would be destroyed by the unforgivables and other major spells while protecting the wearer ? Having a large amount of shrunken Shields that would be automatically unshrunken and fixed on your hand when one is destroyed ? Bludgers who are enchanted to aim incoming spells ?

Fred and George have demonstrated that enchanted clothes can be usefull for minor spells. And they only use a simple Protego enchantment, nothing more powerfull. That means even civilians, with average knowledge of battel spells, can produce armour. What would be the creations of masters in transfiguration, potions and enchantment ?

Half of the song is in Latin, so if they had their wands with them I'll bet they'd blow themselves up.

Hermione ran forward and pulled the hat onto her head.  She heard a tickly little voice musing aloud.

""A lot of native intelligence here, very clever and keen.  Ravenclaw might suit you well...""

Hermione wondered if the hat could hear her worrying about her future prospects.

""Yes, of course.  We're both in here for the moment.  You know, keenness doesn't really cover it.  You might be better placed in Slytherin.  You're more ambitious than most and they could use...""

*Not Slytherin*, she practically screeched it aloud.  *They have a terrible reputation!*

*Not Slytherin!*  And doubting the hat's intentions now, *Not Ravenclaw either!*

""Damn.  GRYFFINDOR.""  Hermione put on a brave face as the hat was lifted off her head.

McGonagall pursed her lips as Neville Longbottom approached at her call a few minutes later.  She had received a couple of letters from Augusta over the holidays and wasn't encouraged.  For her part, Professor McGonagall thought the Longbottom matriarch had odd ideas about how to raise a child but, having no children of her own, couldn't be entirely certain.  She lowered the hat onto Neville's head, and it dropped right down over his eyes.

""Ho, Longbottom!  It's been a while since I last spoke to a member of your family.  Keeping well, are they?""

*Um,* Neville began.

""Never mind, boy, just breaking the ice.  Oh, dear.""  The hat paused and Neville felt the strangest sensation that there was a mind inside his head, a mind besides his own, actually looking around.  ""Oh, dear.  You poor kid.  Oh, wait...""

If asked in the moment, Neville would have described it as feeling as if some mental boxes had been shifted aside.

""You'd make a good Hufflepuff, you know.  Professor Sprout and you will get along swimmingly.""

*But my gran says Huffs are a bunch of duffers and it's probably the best i can do.*

""Your gran doesn't have the insight on you that I do,"" grumbled the hat quietly, as a few cerebral closets were opened and gently sorted.  ""Oh.  Oh!""

*What?*

""GRYFFINDOR!""

*What?  Are you sure?*

""Never been surer, kid.  Off you go, GRYFFINDOR!""

A few more students came and went with somewhat less drama, until...

""Malfoy, Draco.""

The hat came down over Malfoy's sneer as he waited for it to confidently tell him and the rest of the school what he knew was coming, but the voice inside his head surprised him.

""Hufflepuff.""

*What?!  NO!  My father will...I'm supposed to be a Slytherin, like my father!  You don't know what it's like...*

""No, lad, YOU don't know what it's like.  Huff House is full of good people from all walks of life, far more socially conscious than you are, I daresay, and you would benefit from meeting and getting to know them.  Open your eyes a little.""

harrypotter,"(nobody will read this, it's a weird post) 

Hi, I was recently playing on Potterworld (Java edition) and was intrigued by the way casting spells there works. Basically, you right click your wand and the spells appear on your hotbar. If you press Q it changes hotbar. Then, if you select the spell with a number or right click it from the inventory, the spell is selected and left clicking with the wand will cast it. 

So, I wonder if something like that is doable in MCBE world. 

I'm fully aware that some things are not doable in BE and using only commands, so I'll change something. 

First, hotbars. In BE you can use the /replaceitem just fine to make the player have a certain hotbar, so I'd use that or /give to give the player the items. However, unlike on Java, you can't save hotbars, so there's no way to know the hotbar that the player had BEFORE having the spells one selected to restore it. A solution to this might be simply having the world only for that purpose and nothing else, so the player wouldn't even have other stuff in the hotbar. 

To activate spells, I'd drop items. The dropped item would cause the spell to happen, but here's a problem:

The way that Ron and Hermione were like “oh yeah we just popped down to the chamber of secrets to grab a couple of baselisk fangs” casually like they were explaining how they went down to the shop for some beers.

The chamber of secrets can only be accessed by a parseltongue, which is a protection placed on it by slytherin himself so only his heir can be granted access. To think it could be fooled by a non parseltongue making hissing noises at it is pretty ludicrous.

Also, with the diadem, the fiend fire is set in the room of requirement and of all the attacks that could of been possibly used by crabbe(?) in that situation, he just so happened to chose the one very specific spell that can destroy horcruxes.

This wouldn’t be too much of an issue apart from the fact that so much effort and time went into finding and understanding which physical object can destroy a horcrux, and then at the very end they are like “oh actually there is a spell that can do it straight away lol”",Fiend fire and the chamber of secrets,1673005483

You can’t change things that have already happened, you can only use time turners to potentially alter the outcome of events you have no prior knowledge of.

For those unaware of the game mechanics, the player has a finite amount of time in the game where you play out almost every day in a calendar year. The main part of this is going to school, meeting up with your friends for various story beats, and actually doing the classes themselves. This involves certain days where the player is quizzed by the teacher or taking final exams. The character has to balance school, personal development and relationships on top of investigating murders, for example. There’s also part-time jobs to earn money outside of the “dungeon crawler” part of the game which is turn-based.


I think this desire is based on my love for Harry’s everyday school life in a magical school outside of the “saving the world” plot lines.

He wanted to enjoy life as a man without problems and when he takes her in his arms for the first time at the request of the marauders he doesn’t feel that feeling that every father should feel, which James felt with Harry, but just feels an enormous weight on his shoulders but, he calls her Hermione before leaving her at the muggle orphanage because he knew a muggle name would make his mother turn in her grave and that’s why she calls herself by a short name because she didn’t want anything from the man who had left her without caring. They meets years later at the station when everyone is accompanying Harry for his first year and again when Harry invites her over to his house for the holidays having become great friends with the brilliant but silent little girl who has a morbid obsession with playing by the rules. They slowly learns more about her life and that to adopt Hermione was a horrible family that mistreats her, especially her adoptive father who punishes her whenever she doesn’t follow the rules, and then Sirius repents and tries to bond with his daughter and raise her and things like that. Obviously it will be a difficult path and Sirius will have to live with remorse but as soon as he sees her exactly as he was at her age, alone and with few friends he can really call his family, unwanted without knowing why by both of her biological parents and hated by the foster ones, he feels that feeling he hadn’t felt many years ago when he first picked her up. Hermione had his eyes, his hair, his instilled spirit rebellious and loyal to the point of error and that girl, little but strong as a lion, was his responsibility, she was a child, his child, and he had disappointed her already too much. If I weren’t so bad at writing I would do it but I leave the idea here in case someone wants to use it tell me because I would really be happy to read this fanfic.  

2. 
Hermione is the daughter of Sirius and after the end of the war and discovering the truth about her father she goes back to the past to change the future, to save lives, families. She becomes friends with the Marauders, initially suspicious, even if Sirius immediately feels a strange sensation towards her, as if his world suddenly depends on the smile of a little girl who he knows very well he doesn’t love, not the way adults love themselves but the way he saw James’ parents love him, until they see Hermione’s scar. She meets her father, who died before knowing that she was his daughter, and eventually Sirius discovers that Hermione is his biological daughter from the future and for the first time in his life, this life, he had a family that was his own.","Harry Potter FanFiction idea, again, because no one thinks of me so please,pleaseeeeeeees, If anyone wants to write it, let me know.",1672964273

harrypotter,"Was watching Order of the Phoenix and in the scene where Dumbledore's army is caught He takes the full blame for the Army even though he had nothing to do with it. I mean, he had to know that it would eventually come out that Voldemort was indeed back, so how bad would it have been if Harry had gotten blamed? When it came out the Ministry would look bad for not only Denying the truth but punishing a kid for it. Plus I can't imagine the ministry would throw a child in Azkaban so Harry's punishment would be less as the ministry could just claim that Harry was a confused kid.

Instead, he takes the full blame which would have had him sent to Azkaban if he had chosen to Surender to the Minister. And the ministry uses this to undermine him. 

I guess my question is could Dumbledore have known as early as OoTP that he would be dead before Voldemort was defeated and that Harry would need the support of the wizarding world to win, and therefore take the blame to keep Harry's 'reputation' from being besmirched? or was he just shielding Harry from whatever punishment the ministry might have for him?",Did Dumbledore know he would not see the end of Voldemort,1672958491
harrypotter,"Dear all,

Since Hogwarts Legacy will be out in a month, I’ve started to seriously prepare for the release.

One of these preparations is the Harry Potter Fan Club account integration to get some house and wand benefits.

I’ve done the sorting ceremony several times in the past, but never really seriously. Now it is part of the game, I wanted to do it seriously.

However I’m always in between Slytherin and Ravenclaw (tried twice to be sure). 

Could anyone help me out? What would make me either a Slytherin or a Ravenclaw? Some real life characteristics besides the obvious ones?

Thanks all!!!",Which house?,1672958356

harrypotter,"First off, let me clarify a few points: I apologize in advance of this is a repost, it's just something I'd thought of. Second off, note that this is meant to be open discussion/your own fantasy.

That said, let's begin: 
The year is 7 May 1998. Battle of Hogwarts. You are a 17 year old wizard(house, blood status, etc doesn't matter) among those who have chosen to resist He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.

Death Eaters have infiltrated at this point and there is  dueling everywhere. Suddenly, turning around, you see, as if in slow motion, a wall blasted apart and everywhere, your friends lay screaming and dying. 

You see a masked Death Eater raise his wand at Ron and Hermione, using Nagini distracting them to his advantage. What do you do? How Dark do you go?",How Dark are you willing to go?,1672957329
